2,"Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'etat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;11 clear (3 extra)&#10;13 green (1 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;",4,30,12,3,30,Dragonmaster,30,1981,Bob Pepper,"Card Game,Fantasy","G.

5,"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Note: many books and websites list this as a 1962 publication. This is incorrect; information from Sid Sackson's diaries, correspondence, and royalty statements prove that it was published in 1964.

The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent.

Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.

41,"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;",4,30,9,2,30,Can't Stop,30,1980,"Gabriel Laulunen (II),Walter Pepperle,Klaus Wilinski",Dice,Sid Sackson,,"Dice Rolling,Press Your Luck","Asmodee,Borras Plana S.A.,Clipper,Eagle-Gryphon Games,Editrice Giochi,Face2Face Games,franjos Spieleverlag,Miro Company,New Games Order, LLC,Palitoy Ltd.,Parker Brothers,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH",6.85659,9095,2-3

He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up.

219,"Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.&#10;&#10;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.&#10;&#10;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.&#10;&#10;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).&#10;&#10;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little.

334,"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk.

Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:&#10;&#10;a) trump colors (primary &amp; secondary) &#10;b) most or fewest tricks &#10;c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'&#10;&#10;Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.&#10;&#10;After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase.

619,"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.

Some players complained of ambiguities in these rules and the Campaign Game became known as difficult to play, and unbalanced for 2 players to play.  Some commented that the Campaign Game felt &quot;tacked on&quot; to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.  The Campaign Game was further altered for &quot;more realism&quot; by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;3rd Edition Game&#10;&#10;This Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.

The 4.0 version, where unofficial work is involved, is available now on the VASSAL web site as part of the module and as a PDF for printing.&#10;&#10;The 4th Edition Rulebook is specific to the 4th Edition Mapboard and has significant unofficial work to fix various issues.

644,"You are Shipwrecked... to survive, you must compete head-to-head in a bid for food, shelter, water, and friends. These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.&#10;   &#10;This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.&#10;&#10;",4,30,12,2,30,Shipwrecked,30,2000,John Kovalic,Card,"Matthew Kirby,Mark Alan Osterhaus",,Auction/Bidding,Out of the Box Publishing,5.69112,408,2-3

651,"How low can you go? In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.&#10;&#10;If, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare &quot;Zero!&quot; and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;",5,20,8,2,20,Zero,20,1998,Ernst Solèr,Card,Reiner Knizia,,"Set Collection,Trading","AG Müller (AGMüller),ASYNCRON games,Berliner Spielkarten,Blue Orange Games,HomoLudicus,Trefl Joker Line",6.4188,474,2-3
653,"It is a game where everyone simultaneously plays a unique number face down card a la 6 nimmt! (6 Nimmt).&#10;&#10;There are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.&#10;&#10;Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand.

660,"From session report:&#10;A card game. The deck consists of five  different colored sets of cards, each set numbered 1 - 8. There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.&#10;&#10;The cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.&#10;&#10;When collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.&#10;&#10;The basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.&#10;&#10;",5,15,10,3,15,Riffifi,15,2000,Klaus Pōkel,Card,Stefan Dorra,,Simultaneous Action Selection,Winning Moves Germany,5.96609,87,2-3

671,"Bull Run is a tactical combat game of the first battle of Bull Run.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.&#10;&#10;Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.&#10;&#10;The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. &#10; The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine References:&#10;&#10;The GENERAL Index  Article List:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5&#10;        Series Replay - Bull Run, Rex A.

The scoring cards are sorted from lowest to highest and everybody chooses a card from their hand and shows it. The lowest value card wins the lowest scoring card (which could easily be a negative!). That player is out and the remaining players choose another card. Whoever has the lowest total takes the next lowest scoring card and is out, and so on , until there are 2 players left competing for the final scoring card. Again, you add a card to your total, and whoever now has the HIGHEST total wins the last scoring card. Which means that if you can't go for the prize, you try to duck out earlier.

934,"extrapolated from session report:&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.&#10;&#10;The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.&#10;&#10;Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  &#10;Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.&#10;&#10;The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. &#10;&#10;&#10;Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the necklace is completed.

949,"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game.

1035,"A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger&rsquo;s last veteran nco&rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts the advance abandoned with the stunned demise or their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat of been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong...&#10;&#10;This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire against your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armour assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armoured advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows you own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design You Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters or real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles of 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into 8 phases equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armoured warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Be forewarned! Squad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H.

If he draws a trade, each player buys and/or sells one share to the bank. Players then simultaneously choose one of the two cards in their hand and reveal them. If no one played a bank holiday card, then in turn order, the brick associated with each company card advances on the movement track a number of spaces equal to the movement tile drawn, ignoring occupied spaces. The value of a company's shares depends on the location of its brick on the movement track and its position relative to all of the other bricks.

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable.

If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.  Whoever has the most chips on the board at the end of the game wins.  A very interesting twist on the classic Yahtzee mechanism.&#10;&#10;",4,30,8,2,30,Showdown Yahtzee,30,1991,,Dice,(Uncredited),"Yacht,Yahtzee",Dice Rolling,"MB Spiele,Milton Bradley",5.76939,147,2-3

Powerful spell cards are auctioned off each turn using a fixed set of energy stones. (Each player has ten to use throughout the game.) The winning bidder places their winning bid (in energy stones) on the acquired spell card; this card will remain in play for a length of time related to the number of energy stones placed on it. Each turn energy stones are removed from the spell cards, and these energy stones are then available again for future bidding (so these energy stones are recycled throughout the game). The spell cards give each player some resource production (four different kinds of metals) and usually a special ability that can be used in the game.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules.

They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.&#10;&#10;The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.&#10;&#10;A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series&#10;&#10;",4,60,10,2,45,Monad,60,1969,(Uncredited),Card,Sid Sackson,"3M Gamettes,Sid Sackson Signature Series",Set Collection,"3M,Eagle-Gryphon Games,Hexagames (I),Salagames",6.33359,365,2-3

1574,"The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. Over 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

1585,"Burma - The Campaign for Northern Burma, March-August, 1944, is the sixth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers, and covers covers the 1944 campaigns beginning with the Japanese &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1944, two equally matched opponents faced each other in the jungles and mountains of Northern Burma. During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.&#10;&#10;Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply and transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.&#10;&#10;Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).&#10;&#10;Scenario Info:&#10;&#10;    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns&#10;    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet&#10;One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)&#10;Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;",2,120,12,2,120,Burma,120,1999,"Nicolás Eskubi,Dean Essig,David Pentland","Wargame,World War II","Dean Essig,Dave Friedrichs","Country: Burma,Operational Combat Series","Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter","The Gamers,Multi-Man Publishing",7.86019,287,2-3

1718,"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;At last - a money game for adults!&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!  This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.&#10;&#10;Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.&#10;&#10;A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!&#10;&#10;International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.&#10;&#10;The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.&#10;&#10;Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).&#10;&#10;You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.&#10;&#10;From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.&#10;&#10;Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;2-piece fold-out game board&#10;Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad&#10;Net Worth Worksheet pad&#10;Hedging Cost Worksheet pad&#10;24 City Cards&#10;4 Borrowing Cost cards&#10;16 Currency Exchange cards&#10;16 Risk cards&#10;5 player tokens&#10;40 colored markers for 4 different colors&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;",4,60,12,2,60,Foreign Exchange,60,1979,,Economic,Allan Tech,,Commodity Speculation,"Avalon Hill,Gamma Two Games,Teck Enterprises",4.33651,63,2-3

1931,"The &quot;Bust~the~Trust!&quot; Game&#10;&#10;The basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three &quot;accusation circles&quot; respectively. &quot;Accusing&quot; is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended.

1932,"In this game the players follow either the rules for monopolists or those for competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!&#10;&#10;The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).&#10;&#10;Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!&#10;&#10;The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts.

1964,"Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.&#10;&#10;&quot;An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles.

The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.&#10;&#10;Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.&#10;&#10;Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.&#10;&#10;The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:&#10;&#10;The Eye (covers 1 square);&#10;    The Rod (covers 2 squares);&#10;    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);&#10;    The Snake (covers 4 squares);&#10;    The Door (covers 5 squares);&#10;    The Gun (covers 6 squares).&#10;&#10;",6,45,8,2,45,Skirrid,45,1977,,Strategy,"Mark Eliot,Brian Taylor",Polyominoes,Tile Placement,"Clem Toys,Kenner,Skirrid Company of Great Britain, Ltd.",5.64212,113,2-3

2138,"On October 6, 1973, Egyptian forces, lavishly equipped with the latest Soviet weaponry, launched a surprise attack in overwhelming strength against the 436 Israeli infantrymen and 200 tanks that were guarding the Suez Canal.  The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.&#10;&#10;Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.&#10;&#10;History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, &quot;A very near run thing,&quot; that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE    12 hours per turn&#10;MAP SCALE    2.5 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE    Battalion / Brigade&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One to four&#10;PLAYING TIME    Two to twelve hours&#10;&#10;",2,360,12,2,360,Crisis: Sinai 1973,360,1995,Rodger B.

2168,"The game examines the war in Europe at several levels. Operation Barbarossa concentrates on the great ground struggle waged for four long years between Stalingrad and Berlin. The Fall of Germany begins at the eve of the great amphibious invasion of France and expands the war into the West. The War for Europe completes the picture with an examination of the entire 6 years of war in all of its ramifications. Great fleets of bombers may be launched towards enemy targets; swift Axis raiders joined by their deadly brethren, the U-Boat, can attempt to break the British supply line with America; mighty armadas may sail to challenge, in combat, for control of the seas, and much more.&#10;&#10;But Hitler's War does not limit one to just the kind of tactical or strategic decisions normally expected from a wargame. The great choices that faced each government must also be solved. Questions relating to war direction, production priorities, and research allotments become as important to ultimate victory as when to invade Russia or how much force will be needed to overrun France.

A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick.

2428,"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.&#10;&#10;You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.

Your token moves around the perimeter of an array of cards (ingredients) and you pick one from the row or column where you stop.  The number on the card you pick dictates how many spaces you move on your next turn.  You try to collect sets of four matching ingredients and get penalty points if you have only one of a particular ingredient.

Dollar cards are used to indicate that a player sells his/her hot dogs cheaper, and this changes the order in which players are allowed to sell (e.g. a player with 5 hot dogs minus $ 2 is allowed to sell before a player with 4 hot dogs because his/her total of 3 is lower than the other player's 4).

This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.&#10;&#10;Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.&#10;&#10;Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.&#10;&#10;Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.&#10;&#10;Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).&#10;&#10;A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.

2579,"Arctic Front: Battle for Norway:&#10;Arctic Front, the third game of the Third World War series, uses the same rules as its predecessors but presents a very different gaming situation.&#10;The Soviet Leningrad Front, with its special airborne, amphibious, and arctic-equipped contingents, assaults Norway, reinforced with a few elite units from the U.S., Britain, Canada, and other NATO nations.&#10;Norway presents a constricted front to offensive operations. Along the Soviet border, the relatively open terrain in conjunction with possible outflanking moves through Finnish Lappland allows a rapid Soviet advance. The rest of the Norwegian Arctic is mountainous and can be a formidable barrier if well defended. The Soviet player must make full use of his airmobile, airlanding, and marine forces to penetrate this region, while guarding against raids from U.S. marines and British commandos.&#10;The complex relations between the Soviet Union and the neutral Scandinavian nations - Finland and Sweden - has its effects in the game. Soviet forces may attempt to pass through the Finnish Arctic, and Finland may allow violation of its neutrality or offer limited or full resistance. Sweden will always defend its territory, but its effort may not be total. Also, Sweden may volunteer an expeditionary force to join NATO in Norway even if Sweden neutrality is not violated. Finally, the Soviet high command may mandate a general offensive in Scandinavia rather than just operations against Norway, providing additional forces from the strategic reserve for combat in Finland and Sweden.&#10;Additional rules allow Arctic Front to be combined and played with The Third World War and Southern Front, thus covering all the European war zones of the Third World War. Players can reinforce one front with forces from the others, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level.

2580,"Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East:&#10;Persian Gulf uses the same rules as the other games in the Third World War series to show a different aspect of modern warfare operations in the deserts and mountains of the middle east.&#10;Persian Gulf includes a special &quot;game within a game&quot;, covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before - and leading to - the general outbreak of the Third World War. Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.&#10;The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. &#10;Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan.

Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.

You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).

2738,"OVERVIEW:&#10;&#10;The Gnumies &amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;&#10;1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. &#10;2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. &#10;3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. &#10;4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. &#10;5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. &#10;6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.&#10;&#10;7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!&#10;&#10;8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).&#10;&#10;9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!&#10;&#10;10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!&#10;&#10;Ages 8 and up&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",5,20,8,2,20,The Gnumies,20,2001,"Axel Mergard,Barbara Spelger","Card Game,Fantasy",David Parlett,,"Auction/Bidding,Hand Management,Set Collection,Simultaneous Action Selection","AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Rio Grande Games",5.35635,197,2-3

The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady &amp; The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack.

This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins.

Yet this obscure title was quite a gem considering the limitation of games to choose from during its day.&#10;&#10;In 1967 it was re-published by the German firm Otto Maier Verlag, which is the ancestor of Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH Verlag. Numerous re-publications followed (1972, 1977 and others) including at least one which gave the rules in German, English and Italian. It was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.&#10;Components list for these editions are as follows: 160 stock certificates, 68 Market Action cards, 4 price markers, play money, stock price board.&#10;&#10;The 1983 (9th edition) by Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH changes the title slightly to B&ouml;rsenspiel instead of Das B&ouml;rsenspiel and the original rules heavily. Although this set is well-designed and much nicer on the eyes, the bland original version featured larger (regular card deck) size action cards. An extra set of 18 &quot;risk&quot; cards replacing 18 market cards had been added and they act as event cards that immediately effect changes in the market. They cause the unfortunate player who draws one to play it instead of a market card, a chaotic effect that some players will not like.&#10;&#10;",6,75,12,2,75,Broker,75,1961,"Jan ten-Hove,Peter van Roon",Economic,"F.

2963,"A game in which players try to make the most money by trading on the stock market. Players take turns to trade shares in 6 UK companies using information on share price movements available only to you. But every player has different information, hence decisions will be based not only on your cards, but also on the actions of the other players. This calls for guessing and bluffing. &#10;The game is played in a series of trading periods (called Bargain Periods). At the end of each, all players 'pool' their information and this forms the basis of the actual market price movements on each share. By gaining a larger percentage of a company's shares, a player can become Company Director or even Chairman and exert some personal influence on that company's share price. At the end of up to 10 trading periods, players calculate their total value to find the winner.&#10;&#10;",6,90,12,2,90,Stockmarket,90,1987,,Economic,(Uncredited),,"Commodity Speculation,Stock Holding",Jordans Games,6.71909,55,2-3

3035,"The time is: 1630 hrs., 15 June 1815...The Imperial Guard light cavalry of Lefebvre-Desnottes encountered the Nassau infantry of Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.&#10;&#10;The French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.&#10;&#10;The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.&#10;At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.&#10;&#10;By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, altering the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.&#10;&#10;Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French.

Massena has been compelled to yield to superior forces; Sauret has begun his retreat to Desenzano, and the enemy has captured Brescia and the bridge of Ponte San Marco. You see that our communications with Milian are cut off.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ordering Augereau to join him at Roverbella, Bonaparte directed Serurier to raise the siege of Mantova and fall back, to cover the alternate line of communication via Cremona. Although this meant abandoning the precious siege guns, it gave the French the freedom to unite their forces and engage on their own terms, massing against each Austrian wing in turn.&#10;&#10;Staking everything on success, Bonaparte set his forces in motion toward Brescia, leaving a small brigade of 1,500 men at Castiglione to delay three corps of Marshal Wurmser. There was no room for retreat - any reverse would mean utter catastrophe. Bonaparte rode five horses to death, covering 122 kilometers in 42 hours; but the French commander regained the initiative. He routed the Austrians at Lonato, while Wurmser approached Castiglione, a mere five miles away.&#10;&#10;Though he succeeded in turning about and driving Wurmser back into the hills, the contest for Italy was far from over; the Austrian Army would return to hurl themselves against the understrength French forces covering the quadrilateral of fortresses - Verona, Legnano, Peschiera, and the ultimate prize - Mantova.&#10;&#10;Rules: Napoleon at Bay System (48 pages incl. notes)&#10;Quick Set-up Tables: six 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Sheets &amp; Displays&#10;Scenarios: Four (July, September, November 1796 and January 1797&#10;Map: One 22 x 34&quot; section by Joe Youst&#10;Counters: 280 (300 including blanks) two-sided pieces by Youst and Yamazaki&#10;Game Design: Kevin Zucker&#10; If you have played Napoleon at Bay, 1807: The Eagles Turn East, or The Emperor Returns, you already know the rules to Bonaparte in Italy.

Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.&#10;&#10;The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.&#10;&#10;The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.&#10;&#10;The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.&#10;&#10;Every version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).&#10;&#10;",2,180,12,2,180,Gettysburg,180,1958,,"American Civil War,Wargame",Charles S.

3102,"Players bid with colored chips for cards (Card Fatales) which show an Ace or Aces in the 5 colors. The value of the colors start at 6 million and rise and fall according the total chips played. So if 2+ Blue chips are bid, Blue rises by 2 million. But if only one Blue chip was bid, Blue falls by 1 million and if no Blue chips were bid, Blue falls by 2 million. If a color reaches 11 or 12, there is a pay-out for each ace of that color you own, 5 or 6 million, and it is reset to 6 million.&#10;Then the bid chips are taken back one by one, starting with the player to the left of the auction winner.

If you can use all six dice for points, pick them all up and keep going.&#10;&#10;'Bank' your points and end your turn at any time but beware, some scoring dice must be removed after every roll - if no scoring dice at all are rolled your turn ends and score zero points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the winning player reaches a set total of points, usually 10,000.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Dice 10,000 and Ten Grand The Dice Game.

The pieces in the game are cubes that have a circle on one side, a cross on another, and blank faces on the other four; to set up the game, players place the 25 cubes with blanks face-up on the 5x5 grid in the game board.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.&#10;&#10;",4,15,6,2,15,Quixo,15,1995,,Strategy,Thierry Chapeau,"5x5 grid,Combinatorial,Gigamic Basic,Gigamic Classic,Mensa Select,n in a row","Pattern Building,Tile Placement","Family Games, Inc.,Fundex,Gigamic,Oficina do Aprendiz",6.09373,551,2-3
3228,"Pueblo - the ultimate building challenge! Work with the other players to create a mighty home for the Chieftain, stone by stone. You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.&#10;&#10;The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the &quot;Chieftain&quot;  around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;There are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon.&#10;&#10;Original description from box.&#10;&#10;",4,60,10,2,60,Pueblo,60,2002,"Jamel Akib,Ole Höpfner,Joachim Krause,Pinball,Wolfgang Scheit",Strategy,"Michael Kiesling,Wolfgang Kramer",3D Games,"Area Enclosure,Tile Placement",Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,6.88242,2040,2-3

3263,"On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.&#10;During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th.&#10;&#10;&#10;[1st edition]&#10;&#10;Ukraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules.

Through the game, tiles are added to the board by the players with this same restriction.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you add a marker to claim one of the colored spots on the board; up to two markers can be placed on a space.  When you have four adjacent markers that are all on different colors, you can place a tower. Once the tower is placed, this spot is no longer usable for any other marker connections.

The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.&#10;&#10;Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.&#10;&#10;In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile.

Three complete games are included: Sicily-Invade and capture Italy's southern island fortress, Normandy Breakout-Direct the critical campaign on the sweep to Berlin, and Battle of the Bulge-The daring breakthrough to Bastogne.  A two-sided (19&quot; x 26&quot;) game board is provided.&#10;&#10;The game maps are historically accurate, as well as the initial troop deployments. Troop movement per turn is dictated by 24 troop movement cards. Allied and German units are 112 die cut cardboard pieces. Battles are resolved using 5 red and 5 white battle dice.&#10;&#10;The game plays very well for a wargame of its age. The troop movement card deck works better than one might think. Moving the little cardboard counters is typical of wargames of this era. And the battle resolution based upon rolling multiples of any number seems unbalanced at first, but after a few plays you realize that it too works as well as the troop movement card deck.  Two very innovative wargaming mechanisms that allow for quick movement and battle resolution.

3572,"Invasion: America is a wargame designed by Jim Dunnigan and published by SPI in 1976. It depicted a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist coalition, the South American Union, and the Pan Asiatic League. The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map, with 400 cardboard pieces representing the armed forces in the war. As was typical of wargames of this genre, each piece had numerical combat and movement ratings printed on it. The board is divided up into small hexagons (each of which represented approximately 50,000 square kilometers). On each turn a player can move all of his pieces through a number of hexagon spaces equal to its movement rating. Then pieces in adjacent spaces engage in combat by comparing their combat ratings and rolling dice. The combat ratings and the dice roll are cross-referenced to determine the outcome of the combat. Many spaces on the map also have distinctive terrain features like forests or mountains which affect the ratings of units in those spaces.&#10;&#10;Invasion: America is intended as a four player game; one player is the defender and controlls the forces of the United States and Canada (Mexico and Central America were American-occupied territory). The other three players are the three invaders of the coalition. Each turn of the game represents one month and the game lasts for 60 turns. The North American player wins if he still controls a portion of the continent by the game's end. If the North American player loses, whichever of the invading players holds the most territory is the winner. The result is that the invaders cooperated to an extent in attacking the North American player but ultimately were competing against each other.  Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a 1978 sequel, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.&#10;&#10;Issued in both box format and flat tray&#10;&#10;",5,240,12,2,240,Invasion: America,240,1976,Redmond A.

3986,"Battle for Germany game is small, it only takes about three to four hours to play for players of normal skill and luck. The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).&#10;&#10;The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.&#10;&#10;The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.&#10;&#10;",4,180,12,2,180,Battle for Germany,180,1975,"Christine Lockwood,David McElhannon,Mark Simonitch,Redmond A.

At that time, I had been working on designing games for about eight years (since I first discovered the AH games.) Before that, I was always interested in the details of history, and how they were connected. AH wargames were the first time I saw someone else thinking the same way, and doing it in a novel way.  I was always building on that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had been designing a similar game, called Italy, which incorporated the rest of the Italian theater, with a smaller scale map of the Anzio area (ie, two interrelated games, one strategic and the other operational). But when Dave's game came in I thought it did a better job of the Anzio section.

Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Holland.

At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.&#10;&#10;During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.&#10;&#10;As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive?

4146,"By November of 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte was eight months into a brilliant campaign in northern Italy which was removing any Austrian threats to the French Republic's southern flank. The fighting that month, north of the besieged city of Mantua, proved to be one of the first great challenges in the young General Bonaparte's career. Two Austrian forces under Marshal Alvinczy and Lt. General Davidovitch threatened to converge on the French from the north and east, join together at Verona, and march southwards to raise the siege. Bonaparte's task was to make use of his interior lines around Verona to unite his scattered and out-numbered troops, and defeat the separate wings of the Austrian &quot;pincers&quot; in detail.&#10;&#10;BATTLE for ITALY is Avalon Hill's new strategy game for two players which recreates the critlcal period of November. 1796. During a typical game turn, both players attempt to move their brigades by normal and forced marches. Combat occurs when opposing forces move adjacent to each other. and is resolved by a die roll on the Combat Results Table. Important leaders on both sides are represented in play, and their Individual attributes are critical to each players success. Game victory depends on how well the Austrians do in defeating the French and exiting units off of the map to break the siege.&#10;&#10;BATTLE for ITALY contains a colorful map of northern Italy around Verona, 100 playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing Time: 1 1/2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity Rating: 4&#10;&#10;(from 1-10, 10 the highest)&#10;&#10;source: back of the box&#10;&#10;",2,60,12,2,60,"Arcola: The Battle for Italy, 1796",60,1979,"Larry Catalano,Jacques-Louis David","Napoleonic,Wargame","Tom Walczyk,Kevin Zucker","Campaigns of Napoleon System: 1x Series,Cities: Mantova,Country: Italy",Hex-and-Counter,"Avalon Hill,OSG (Operational Studies Group)",6.25476,168,2-3
4168,"Blitzkrieg is one of Avalon Hill's earlier releases. The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major countries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Blitzkrieg is one of the classic Avalon Hill war games that set up the military simulation board game hobby.&#10;&#10;Blitzkrieg is a board game with printed cardboard square pieces played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Monopoly playboard. Printed on the mapboard is a map on a hexagonal grid (hex spaces, or simply &quot;hexes&quot;), and terrain for land, beach, cities, rivers, roads, mountain, desert, and borders. There are a few charts, such as the one for the combat results table, and a die for random outcomes.&#10;&#10;The cardboard pieces represent large military units. There are brigades, divisions, squadrons and air wings. The different types of military units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, shock artillery, fighters and bombers. Navel action is allowed but abstracted.&#10;&#10;There are three levels of the game, the basic game (simplest), advanced (all the complicated rules), and tournament (fast play with advance rules). There are optional rules for the advanced game. The basic game only includes the land game, no naval invasions, and is the best starter tool for new gamers. The basic game has a more simplified combat results table. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.&#10;&#10;The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hexgames. So once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game was not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics, once you learned one game all of the other played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.&#10;&#10;The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had rating printed in large print on the piece, (or &quot;chits,&quot; as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, the higher the odds will favor that side.&#10;&#10;Also in combat, terrain would impact combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).&#10;&#10;When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.&#10;&#10;In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seem to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.&#10;&#10;",2,90,12,2,90,Blitzkrieg,90,1965,,Strategy,"Larry Pinsky,Thomas N.

4172,"Veracruz: U.S. Invasion of Mexico, was originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #63. Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.&#10;&#10;European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.&#10;&#10;The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player.

Although the siege of Leningrad had been broken, the city was far from secure. This battle was intended to guarantee the Leningrad&rsquo;s safety. The game depicts February 10, 1943, a day which would come to be known to the Spanish as &ldquo;Black Wednesday.&rdquo; The battle is a microcosm of Soviet offensive operations in World War II.

It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.&#10;&#10;The German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian&rsquo;s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash.

The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history.

4287,"Wargame based around the WW2 Western Allied campaign from just after the Normandy invasion to the crossing of the Rhine.&#10;&#10;First significant mechanic is the unpredictable turn order - players dice for each turn, with the highest taking the turn. However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).&#10;&#10;Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.&#10;&#10;These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.&#10;&#10;The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.&#10;&#10;Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game. The big mounted map with large hexes and counters remove the 'fiddle factor' which can blight wargames with lower production values.&#10;&#10;Republished in Command Magazine Japan #64 in 2005.&#10;&#10;",2,240,12,2,240,Onslaught,240,1987,Sawshun Yamaguchi,"Wargame,World War II",Douglas Niles,,"Action Point Allowance System,Hex-and-Counter","Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

4370,"What a fuss. The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.&#10;&#10;In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!&#10;&#10;Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.&#10;&#10;The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.&#10;&#10;At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.&#10;&#10;You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!&#10;&#10;",5,90,10,2,90,Fische Fluppen Frikadellen,90,2002,"Lars-Arne ""Maura"" Kalusky,PeKa",Economic,Friedemann Friese,,Pick-up and Deliver,2F-Spiele,6.62484,917,2-3

4479,"Known in French as &quot;Le fortuniste&quot;, Ratrace is all about social success. You start out in life with $200, a Credit Card and a Business in the Working Class (outer ring of the board) and your objective is to get into the Middle Class and eventually High Society (inner ring). You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.&#10;&#10;With six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to &quot;Other Purchases&quot;. Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.&#10;&#10;You can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.&#10;&#10;To enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again. The risk with marriage is that you may end up on a Divorce square...&#10;&#10;From a Waddington ad dated 1976:  &quot;A macho game of Social Climbing - Do you have what it takes to be a success?

You must predict the chances of being able to take the other players' cards that are laid down during each round. There is no drawing or discarding. You must predict exactly &ndash; hence the name Xactika &ndash; the number of rounds in which you will be able to take the cards played. Cards that appear too weak to take a trick initially may become strong enough to do so as the hand evolves. Players must recognize the value of their hand, not just from having the highest point cards in one of the four combinations on each card, but also from an understanding of the chances that for some of their other cards that no cards of the same combination may remain in the hands of the other players. Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.&#10;&#10;To play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks.

5035,"Panzer Armee Afrika: Rommel in the Desert, April 1941 - November 1942, is a simulation of the North African Campaign between April 1941 and November 1942.  Battalion, Regiment and Brigade-sized units represent the actual forces which took part in the fighting. Included in the game is a Variable Orders-of-Battle Chart that offers variations in forces to demonstrate how history might have been different.&#10;&#10;The game spans the entire 20-month campaign, allowing players to recreate the famous battles of the period between the British-led Commonwealth forces and the Axis forces of Germany and Italy, to include Rommel's Panzer Army Africa. Set at an operational level, players must manage their military forces and precious supplies better than their opponent to achieve victory.  The Axis aims at capturing Alexandria, the key to the Suez Canal.  The British player has to prevent all this.&#10;&#10;When originally published by Simulations Publications, Incorporated (SPI) within the pages of Strategy and Tactics magazine, it was meant to be a very different treatment of a subject made familiar to wargamers in the Avalon Hill Game Company's Afrika Korps (1964). Different it indeed was, introducing a number of novel twists to what seemed to otherwise be a very traditional-style hex-and-counter wargame.  It became a classic in its own right alongside Afrika Korps; Avalon Hill republished Panzer Armee Afrika in a second edition.&#10;&#10;The game is a very tense, very suspenseful contest of sweeping maneuver, lunging attacks, desperate retrogrades, filled with threat, counter-threat, surprises, and more.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #40 magazine (Sep/Oct 1973).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 month&#10;Hex: 12 miles / 19 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Strategy &amp; Tactics version):&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; color mapsheet&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12-page multi-fold rules booklet&#10;&#10;Complexity: Low&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 8-10 Hours&#10;&#10;",2,180,12,2,180,Panzer Armee Afrika,180,1973,"Rodger B.

The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result.

5335,"Horse Soldiers: Forrest at Bay (1988), (Included in Issue #119 0f Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine), is part of the Great Battles of the American Civil War series (GBACW). This series is an offshoot of the Terrible Swift Sword (TSS) system.&#10;&#10;Included are two color map sheets and one sheet of 200 two-sided, die-cut counters and a 2nd half-sheet with 100 die-cut counters. These components represent the participants and locations of two ACW Confederate Cavalry engagements that involved the southern raider, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.&#10;&#10;All game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.&#10;&#10;This game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system. New rules for Cavalry and a modified sequence of play are just couple of the many refinements. I've always wanted to adapt these refinements to the earlier TSS Cavalry game Rebel Sabers: Civil War Cavalry Battles by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.).

They depict specific situations of crucial parts of the war&#10;2)The Campaign Game: It combines the four afforementioned games and fill in the gaps so that the campaign can be played out in sequence&#10;3)The Variable situations: Several &quot;what if&quot; historical effects are examined when added to the above games.&#10;&#10;The Game includes a 23&quot; by 29&quot; map sheet that portrays the area os the Soviet Union in which the operations took place.&#10;A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regularize the movement and the position of the playing pieces.&#10;The combat map is all inclusive with a Terrain Effects Chart (TEC) and Combat Results Table(CRT)&#10;There are two types of units each repressenting one of the opposing armies.Each piece is distinguished by type strenght nationality and mobolity.&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;Each player moves his Units and executes attacks in turn.Players have as an objective to destroy the enemy units and gaining territory whilst minimizing friendly unit loses.&#10;The combat is resolved by comparing attack and defence strengths of adjacent opposing units and expressing the comparison as a simplified probability ratio(odds)&#10;After the defender has chosen which CRT table will be used a die is rolled and the outcome indicated by cross referencing the die roll result and the odds column is applied to the unit being attacked.&#10;Barbarossa is played in turns.&#10;Each Game-turn is composed of two player turns that are divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;",2,360,14,2,360,Barbarossa: The Russo-German War 1941-45,360,1969,Redmond A.

5656,"(David A. Vandenbroucke review - http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt):&#10;&#10;France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.&#10;&#10;Complexity is rated as &quot;low,&quot; and solitaire suitability is &quot;medium.&quot;  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.&#10;&#10;For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.&#10;&#10;The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).&#10;Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.&#10;&#10;",2,360,12,1,360,France 1944: The Allied Crusade in Europe,360,1986,"Ted Koller,James Talbot","Wargame,World War II",Mark Herman,,Hex-and-Counter,Victory Games (I),6.14143,140,2-3

The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.&#10;&#10;10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.&#10;&#10;Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.&#10;&#10;But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course.

Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.&#10;&#10;The battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War.&#10;&#10;Now, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign. See if you have the skill to crush or save the Soviet Empire in 1941.&#10;&#10;",4,360,0,1,360,Typhoon!,360,1995,"John Kranz,Rodger B.

6929,"Ranger is a tactical, role-playing simulation of a Ranger patrol on a combat mission. The game places the player in the role of the patrol&rsquo;s leader. It allows the player to experience some of the decisions that face a Ranger patrol leader.&#10;&#10;From the Designer's Notes: &quot;In designing Ranger, I have attempted to do two things. First, I wanted to give the wargamer a realistic simulation of Ranger operations. Second, I felt the need to keep the game playable. Most tactical games have hundreds of complicated rules to memorize, but bear no relation to actual field maneuvers . . . Patrolling suits solitaire gaming fairly well. While conventional operations are the result of the efforts of numerous commanders and staff officers, patrols generally depend entirely on the patrol leader's actions . . . I made every attempt to present the tactical situations as the patrol leader would experience them. I wanted the game system to avoid excessive administrative bookkeeping and rules memorization . . . I tried to simulate patrolling from my own experiences and not be tied to more standard wargame conventions . . . The element of chance throughout Ranger is by design. No patrol leader can control his environment. He can only plan for as many possibilities as he has time and be alert and prepared to implement these contingency plans if necessary. Even the most experienced player making all the correct decisions will occasionally be destroyed. Combat is always dangerous, but even more so when forward of friendly lines.&quot;&#10;&#10;Components: Rules of Play booklet, Patrolling Tactics booklet, Tactical Events booklet, laminated game map, laminated Patrol Record Log, plastic Tactical Template, Glossary folder, Combat Results Card, Tactical Reference Card, Extended Patrolling Card, 18 Mission Cards, 2 six-sided dice, China marker pencil.&#10;&#10;",1,60,12,1,60,Ranger,60,1984,,Strategy,Bill Gibbs,"Solitaire Games,Solitaire Wargames",Simulation,Omega Games (I),6.86746,126,2-3

Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.&#10;&#10;Fifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including &quot;Operations Points&quot; and &quot;Friction Points&quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory &quot;Rhein-Main Raid&quot;, a more advanced &quot;The Battle for Fulda&quot;, and the campaign game, &quot;Fifth Corps&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area.

NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap.

7112,"Often misquoted as &quot;the monster game of modern warfare&quot;, NATO Division Commander is a much-maligned SPI WWIII title that, because of being widely misunderstood, is often more studied than played.&#10;&#10;Described in the rules as a &quot;battalion level simulation of conflict in contemporary Europe&quot;, NATO Division Commander gradually introduces players to the most complex version of mechanics through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty, the easiest of which is simple, fun, can be expanded, and should not be avoided.  When completely addressed, the game is a War College-level education on the conduct of World War III operations at Division/Brigade level between NATO and Soviet forces. The game system builds on the combat-as-part-of-movement late-SPI systems such as Next War and Fifth Corps, and has as one of its basic premises the idea that unit strength is subordinate to tactical and command considerations.&#10;&#10;Central to its uniqueness, NATO Division Commander contains two identical mapboards and rules for Controller play, producing a refereed, double-blind, fog-of-war effect which is still unique today, more than 30 years after publication.  The game includes solitaire and face-to-face rules to help controllers build up their knowledge of the game, and decide what they will include, and what slows the game down too much for their taste: thus allowing the game experience to be controlled for the players' experience and expectations. It also allows testing of scenarios before controller use.&#10;&#10;Scenarios are comprehensive and infinitely flexible, which makes demands of controllers, and offer a unique playing experience for those peering down the gun barrel.&#10;&#10;With 1200 counters, rule books, and a pile of playing aids, NATO Division Commander still is, the one true smorgasbord of World War III land-based operational simulations.&#10;&#10;",2,360,14,1,360,NATO Division Commander,360,1980,Redmond A.

7138,"New England Simulations revisits a familiar World War II venue -- the hedgerows of Normandy -- with some refreshing twists in The Killing Ground: Campaign for Normandy, July-August 1944&quot;. The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).&#10;&#10;As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.&#10;&#10;The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player (in contrast with maps from games like The Gamers' &quot;Thunder at the Crossroads&quot;, where the vibrant color can make you cross-eyed). Hues of gray and green predominate. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.&#10;&#10;The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.&#10;&#10;In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment.

The  game system allocates to each man (counter) a certain amount of action points (depending on his experience) and permits certain activities based on his status (for example a cautious soldier will take more points to take a risky action). The number of action points determines when a unit may move and what it can do.  Both players bid for initiative and the winner moves a soldier; this progresses until the turn is over.

If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game.

7858,"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;December 16, 1944&#10;After a period of fog, rain, and snow blankets the area, three German armies unleash 26 divisions against thinly held American lines in the Ardennes forest of Belgium and Luxembourg. The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?&#10;&#10;Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a &quot;bulge&quot; in the American line.&#10;&#10;Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43.&#10;&#10;The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the &quot;Bulge enthusiast&quot; and the casual player will enjoy. German attacks follow historical advance routes, and the Bastogne and St. Vith defense perimeters are often as large as they were historically (instead of one big stack of units in the town itself). The Allied player has a chance at holding Elsenborn Ridge and making the Germans pay dearly for the twin villages of Rockerath and Krinkelt. Likewise, the German player has an equal chance of changing history and reaching the Meuse River.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 12 hours per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 1.6 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Regimental-level including battalions for tank units and some infantry battalions&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two&#10;SPECIAL FEATURES: &raquo;Night Turns &raquo;Tank Destroyers &raquo;Weather &raquo;Air Supply &raquo;Determined Attack/Defense Options &raquo;Traffic Jams &amp; Roadblocks &raquo;Bridge Demolition/Construction &raquo;Disengagement &raquo;Armor ratings &raquo;Corps level artillery &raquo;von Der Heydte's parachute battalion &raquo;Skorzeny's 150th Panzer Brigade&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Simonitch&#10;DEVELOPER: Tony Curtis&#10;MAP ART &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;",2,360,12,2,360,Ardennes '44,360,2003,"Rodger B.

8056,"&quot;We struck at Guadalcanal to halt the advance of the Japanese. We did not know how strong he was, nor did we know his plans. We knew only that he was moving down the island chain and that he had to be stopped ... From that moment in 1942, the tide turned, and the Japanese never again advanced.&quot;&#10;&#10;-- Maj. Gen. Alexander A. Vandegrift, USMC &#10;Commanding General, 1st Marine Division&#10;&#10;On the morning of August 7, 1942, the U.S. Marines landed on the beaches of Guadalcanal, marking the first American offensive against Japan in the Pacific in World War II. The bitter and protracted struggle that followed involved major elements of the navies and air forces of both sides.&#10;&#10;Guadalcanal was the operation that started the Allies on the road to Tokyo. From here the U.S. Marines would later launch the invasions of the Palau Islands, Bougainville and Guam. Operation Shoestring is a company-level game focusing on that dramatic first conflict.&#10;&#10;OPERATION SHOESTRING simulates this fascinating campaign &amp; includes special rules to simulate such unique aspects of the battle as: Innovative combat resolution, integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, shore bombardment, air support, and even Banzai charges into one easy-to-use system.

8129,"The gameplay for Sluff Off! follows the standard trick-taking formula: The cards are numbered 1-15 in five different suits, and blue is always trump. If someone leads a color, you must follow suit if you can; otherwise, you can throw off a card or trump the trick.&#10;&#10;It's an exact-bidding game, but you predict your tricks by taking colored chips. For each trick that you win, you toss a chip back. If you take a trick in a color for which you didn't have a chip, then you must take a black chip (worth -3 points). If you have any colored chips left at the end of the round, they're worth -2 points. If you have any white chips left at the end of the round (wildcards that you get when someone takes a colored chip away from you during bidding), they're worth -4 points.&#10;&#10;There's also the Sluffer, whose role is to feed unwanted tricks to other players. Instead of bidding tricks the Sluffer takes 4 black chips each woth -1 for him at the end of the hand. When players take tricks they didn't predict, they take black chips from the Sluffer. If the Sluffer feeds enough of the black chips to other players, it can zero out the Sluffer's score for that round.&#10;&#10;",5,30,10,3,30,Sluff Off!,30,2003,"Damon S.

8132,"From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;At the end of November 1939, the Red Army sent about 450,000 men into Finland in an attempt to conquer the Soviet Union&rsquo;s much smaller neighbor. In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.&#10;&#10;The Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.&#10;&#10;Talvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the &ldquo;Red Finns&rdquo; seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvaj&auml;rvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a &ldquo;variable impulse&rdquo; game system to model the two armies&rsquo; very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army&rsquo;s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data. There are 280 playing pieces and a 34x22-inch map.&#10;&#10;",2,360,14,2,360,Winter Fury: The Battle of Tolvajärvi 1939,360,2001,,"Wargame,World War II",Michael Bennighof,"Avalanche Press Chitpull Series,Avalanche Press WWII Battles Series,Country: Finland","Chit-Pull System,Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Variable Phase Order",Avalanche Press Ltd.,5.89375,56,2-3

There are three segments per turn in which each player must begin by deciding whether they will move and then attack or attack and then move.  Not only is combat strength compared but also a unit's tactical rating when resolving combats.  The side with the higher tactical rating gets to draw more random chits most of which have beneficial drms for that side. To a limited extent combat losses can be converted into retreats and enemy retreats can occasionally result in an additional advance for the attacker.  Occasionally, extreme die rolls allow additional spontaneous activities.  ZoCs are hard except friendly units allow tracing supply through them.  Loss of supply reduces unit effectiveness and can result in attrition.  Victory is determined mostly by units losses but also the Soviet control of objective cities and the presence of even one friendly unit on the other players side of the Donets river provides a healthy number of VPs.

8402,"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Great Pacific War is Avalanche Press' strategic-level game of the War in the Pacific. The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.&#10;&#10;The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.&#10;&#10;The facts:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.&#10;     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).&#10;&#10;&#10;The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.&#10;&#10;In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.&#10;&#10;In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Three 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps, &#10;560 playing pieces, &#10;rules, &#10;three scenario books, &#10;political events and charts.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: &#10;The maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. &#10; The game marries up with JP's Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.&#10;&#10;",7,360,12,2,360,The Great Pacific War,360,2003,,"Wargame,World War II",Brian L.

8571,"Before tomorrow evening, that army will be mine.&quot;&#10;&#10;So claimed Napoleon Bonaparte to his staff on the night of December 1, 1805, as he watched the Austro-Russian Allied army settle into its positions near Austerlitz for the battle that was certain to come the next morning. It was not an idle boast.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Grande Armee mustered 75,000 men, well-led, superbly trained, and completely confident of victory. And the next day, they would win the most decisive victory of Napoleon's career.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Austerlitz was Napoleon's tactical masterpiece. Facing an Allied army 72,000 men strong, he blocked a massive Allied flanking movement aimed at his right wing, launched an attack that smashed the Allied center, and then scattered the remnants so thoroughly that by the night of December 2nd the Allied Third Coalition was in ruins.&#10;&#10;The battle contained many moments of high drama: the French right wing holding on despite 3-to-1 odds, desperately waiting for help from Davout's corps rushing to the battlefield after an epic forced march; a massive cavalry melee fought on the northern half of the field between the opposing cavalry reserves; the clash of the French and Russian Imperial Guards on the Pratzen Heights that decided the course of the battle.&#10;&#10;Austerlitz 1805 is a detailed wargame, on a tactical level, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, featuring...&#10;&#10;1) A chit-based Command system where players randomly draw command chits to determine which division or corps may activate at that moment -- activation is not automatic. Commanders must roll to activate when their chit is drawn, and missing the die-roll leads to the Command Breakdown Table -- disasters can happen.&#10;&#10;2) A Combat system that includes all of the detail that fans of Napoleonic tactics know and love. All of the formations are there -- line, column, skirmish -- each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Players will soon learn that proper unit interaction is crucial for victory, with artillery wearing down the enemy line, infantry creating a breakthrough, and cavalry exploiting the breakthrough with a thundering charge.&#10;&#10;3) Special units and rules to add a distinctive historical flavor: the Tirailleurs Po and Tirailleurs Corse, elite battalions of French skirmishers; the exotic Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard, matched against the Russian Cossacks; the fearsome French Grand Battery; the early morning Fog that blanketed the battlefield and so bedeviled the battle's opening moves.&#10;&#10;4) Six scenarios -- two full-battle scenarios; three smaller one or two map scenarios covering the significant actions, plus a learning scenario providing an introduction to the game's mechanics.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE 20 minutes per turn &#10;MAP SCALE 150 yards per hex &#10;UNIT SCALE infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries&#10;&#10;",2,240,12,2,240,Austerlitz 1805: Napoleon's Greatest Victory,240,2000,"Rodger B.

Historically this offensive destroyed one entire Nazi Army Group, and prevented large transfers of men and equipment to the newly formed Western Front where the Anglo-American forces were expanding their beachhead in preparation for the August Breakout. The game covers the first twenty days of the offensive, during which all the decisive action took place. There are several scenarios, depicting a variety of likely possibilities, from the historical one through various degrees of German preparedness and 'sanity'.&quot;&#10;&#10;Units represent Russian corps and Axis divisions. Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing &quot;Stand Fast&quot; orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 km&#10;Units: Kampfgruppe to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 28&quot; map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)&#10;&#10;",2,120,12,2,120,Destruction of Army Group Center,120,1973,Redmond A.

Each unit represents either one vehicle or one &quot;fireteam&quot; (four infantrymen).&#10;&#10;The game scale is 50 meters per hex and 40 seconds per Game-Turn. Each Game-Turn is comprised of a Fire Phase, followed by a Movement Phase, during which the players alternate moving units (those that have not fired), and terminating with an Indirect Fire Phase, during which the players employ and assess fire from off-map artillery and mortar units.&#10;&#10;Firefight makes extensive use of tables to express the strength of a firing unit against a particular target at a given distance. This strength (or firepower rating) is then referred to a Combat Results Table. This procedure allows us to rate different weapon systems versus different target types with much greater accuracy than heretofore. Another innovation is the integration of the terrain effects directly onto the CRT's. Results are colour-coded to graphically display the protection offered by woods, building and defilade (hull-down) positions. The whole effect is a much simpler, but more accurate system of combat.&#10;&#10;Firefight is presented in three stages. Firefight I, II and III.

The regular Yahtzee rules listed below are used (except that there are thirty-nine categories instead of thirteen). The columns on the score sheet are divided into first, second and third with a multiplier added to each. For First column the scores are just added up, for second column the scores are doubled and for third column the scores are tripled so in effect throwing 4 - 6's in column one would be valued at 24 but those same 4 - 6's put in column three would be worth 72 points. Therefore it is important to put your very good scores in the third column.&#10;&#10;Yahtzee rules: A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.

There are scenarios covering the 1805 campaign against Austria, the 1806 campaign against Prussia and the 1809 campaign against Austria (again). The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario.

The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI. La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders.

About 8 different kinds of artillery and infantry, with varying levels of performance. Units have a morale rating, which determines how much fire they can face before likely becoming demoralized, and some units are green. Units have varying amounts of troops in them, and the scale is small enough that some units can be deployed to take up 2 hexes when marching or in line formation.

All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&amp;Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.&#10;&#10;Better yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe.

Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II.

9673,"This &lsquo;heavyweight&rsquo; strategy game for two players was invented by Frank Czarnetzki, better known for illustrating the Cwali games Logistico and Subulata under the name of Czarne. A herd of 10 working elephants is hard to keep in check. Their job is to collect tree trunks, and the need to be carefully moved over the working area to accomplish this. To keep rival elephants from snatching trunks out from under their trunk or sending elephants off on the wrong path, two elephants have a special designation: Black Elephants, which have the ability to block spaces and can also capture rival elephants.&#10;&#10;[Text from a preview by Spielbox]&#10;&#10;",2,30,10,2,30,Black Elephant,30,2004,Czarnè,Strategy,Czarnè,Animals: Elephants,"Area Movement,Pick-up and Deliver",LudoArt Verlag,7.73661,56,2-3
9674,"In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to her worst-scoring color, not her best, so she needs to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from her rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, she scores one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, she immediately takes another turn. At the end of her turn, she refills her rack to six tiles. (Before refilling her rack, if she has no tiles on it that contain hexes in her lowest-scoring color, she can discard all of her tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see his partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.&#10;&#10;",4,45,10,1,45,Ingenious,45,2004,"Michaela Kienle,Fabio Maiorana,Scott Nicely,Simone Peruzzi,Nick Whyles",Strategy,Reiner Knizia,"Ingenious,Mensa Select,Solitaire Games","Hand Management,Partnerships,Pattern Building,Tile Placement","999 Games,Bard Centrum Gier,Brain Games,Damm / Egmont,Devir,Egmont Litas,Esdevium,Fantasy Flight Games,Filosofia Éditions,Giochi Uniti,Green Board Game Co.,Hobby Japan,Hobby World,Kaissa Chess & Games,Kärnan,Kirjalito,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,KOSMOS,Laser plus,Litor,Mass Games,MINDOK,Nexus,Piatnik,Sophisticated Games,Stupor Mundi,Tilsit,White Goblin Games",7.17603,12910,2-3

9969,"Speculation is a game about having as much worth as possible when the game ends. And unlike some Monopoly-like games, this one definitely ends when one of the draw piles are empty.&#10;&#10;You start the game with &euro;150,000 and that's all the money you get from the bank. No beauty contests to win here, so you'd better spend them wisely. You will get cards with collectible items, though. And a the item value increases the more items you have in the collection. So getting lots of cards in one collection is good, but naturally there is a risk - each collection can possibly be fake and worth nothing. This is controlled by the Insider Information cards which sometimes are available for auction in the game.&#10;&#10;Another interesting aspect of the game is the trading part. If you put cards down on the table, they are always for sale, and if an opponent happens to land on Trade, he can buy a category from you (for the market value). However, you can never lose money on showing your cards, but your opponent may increase his collection and therefore earn more - unless they are fake, of course.&#10;&#10;The final balancing aspect is that the cards that you don't show are not declared properly, so if you land on Tax Razzia, you have to pay for those cards.&#10;&#10;There are also bank-controlled auctions.&#10;&#10;Speculation is a very well balanced, exciting and different economic game and you don't know for sure who's the winner until it's all over.&#10;&#10;The game is in Swedish and scales well from three to five players.

10300,"Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #220.&#10;&#10;Group of Soviet Forces Germany features a simulation of a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Germany in the late 1970's. It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.&#10;&#10;This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, &quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s&quot;. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.&#10;&#10;The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.&#10;&#10;The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations.

10301,"This game is a simulation of a real-world event. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield, A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took pare in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this ways (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;One of four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.

10641,"June 1941 -- the German juggernaut rolls over the Soviet Army. As the tally of encirclements and surrenders mounts, the German advance appears unstoppable to Hitler and many others. However, the officers and men at the front are beginning to have serious misgivings -- not in themselves, but in the pre-war intelligence estimates that they had received. They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so. There seemed to be no end to these tenacious Russian defenders. As the German forces continued their eastward advance, more and more soldiers began asking, &quot;What have we gotten ourselves into?&quot;&#10;&#10;Kiev, the first major German objective in the south, did not fall on schedule. In fact, Soviet resistance was so fierce that it required diverting Guderian's Panzer Group away from the advance on Moscow. Kiev fell in one of the greatest encirclements of the Second World War, but the German advance on Moscow was delayed for several critical weeks.

Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army.

11269,"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;During the summer of 1941, the forces of German Army Group North appeared to be advancing irresistibly toward Leningrad, the second largest city in the Soviet Union, and the birthplace of the Communist revolution. But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.&#10;&#10;In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.&#10;&#10;In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.&#10;&#10;The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)&#10;&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters&#10;&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  &#10;MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   &#10;UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS Vance von Borries&#10;DEVELOPER Tony Curtis&#10;MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: &#10;1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.&#10;&#10;2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?&#10;&#10;4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.&#10;&#10;",2,180,12,2,180,Roads to Leningrad,180,2004,"Rodger B.

11436,"By February 1814, Wellington had invested the French city of Bayonne and was pressing into the French interior with two goals in mind: driving the French army away from the important port city of Bordeaux, and bringing Soult's army to bay. Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.&#10;&#10;On February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.&#10;&#10;Orthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack. Command control plays a critical role, and highlights the differences between Wellington's veteran and well-established command hierarchy and Soult's more makeshift organization. British advantages include numerical superiority, command flexibility and their excellent infantry. The main French advantage is the terrific defensive terrain and the defense of interior lines. Make no mistake though, this is a very tough battle for the French.&#10;&#10;In addition to the main battle scenario, there are several smaller scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a long evening. A variety of optional rules are included to provide replayability and variability for face to face or solitaire play.&#10;&#10;La Bataille D'Orthez will feature two hand drawn maps of the battlefield by Rick Barber, as well as 420 state of the art counters and the usual assortment of charts and tables.

11437,"In May of 1813, Napoleon began the campaign for Germany with a bang - as was his custom. The Prussian and Russian armies attempt to ambush the French main army strung out in road march. Their approach goes undetected and they are able to close within two miles. In fact, not until the moment of their assault do the French become aware of them. But, instead of the expected weak flank guard, they are met by the strong divisions of Souham and Girard and by mid-afternoon, Napoleon and 100,000 French and their allies have swarmed to their support. The battle raged in ever-mounting fury until night finally brought an end to the slaughter. The first major battle of the 1813 campaign ends with thousands of dead and wounded and with the Russian and Prussian armies in full retreat.&#10;&#10;La Bataille de Lutzen simulates the first major clash of Napoleons 1813 campaign. Lacking adequate cavalry and handicapped by a large number of raw recruits, the French player must rapidly consolidate his scattered forces to counter the sudden Allied attack. As the player commanding the Allied forces, you must deal the French a decisive blow before Napoleon can react and bring reinforcements to bear.&#10;&#10;Lutzen is ideal for multiple players or solitaire study.

11695,"The topic of the game is the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union.&#10; Players control the actual units that fought in the campaign. Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian, Spanish and Romanian units. German tank units provide the real striking power for the Axis, and these are the strongest units in the game. The German infantry is also numerous and strong. The other Axis units are not usually as powerful as the German ones, though the Hungarian unit is good and there is a Romanian cavalry corps.&#10;&#10;Soviet units are generally armies. Some of these are able to stand up to the Germans, but most cannot; while the Soviets start out with a very powerful army the first Axis turn is rough on the Red Army.  The Soviet player must place his or her forces carefully and choose the time and place for counter-attacks. The Soviet player does have the aid of fleets in both the Baltic and the Black Seas, allowing landings behind enemy lines and sometimes support in combat. The Red Army of Workers and Peasants has many tank units, but they are not as strong as the German panzers. It can counter with paratroopers and shock troops, special units not available to the Axis.&#10;&#10;The original game was published in 2004.

This action was one of the few in the Civil War where the South actually outnumbered the Federals. The battle was closely fought and the game recaptures the spirit of the struggle for victory. After the disasters at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the South's hope was to secure one decisive victory in the west.  Large portions of the Army of Northern Virginia were detached to bolster the hard-luck Army of Tennessee.  After being maneuvered out of Chattanooga without a fight, Braxton Bragg's army struck the Union forces under Rosecrans on the Chickamauga Creek.  The bloody battle of Chickamauga ensued...&#10;&#10;Its the fourth game in the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series of games by The Gamers&#10;&#10;This is a game of that hard-fought, evenly balanced battle.

If you own the original 1995 edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, or if you have the upgrade kit, you can continue playing those versions with no problems; those versions still stand the test of time quite well. In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.&#10;&#10;Specifically:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps. He's used the original work and maps from Rick Barber and Joe Youst's first two versions as a base, and come up with another of his clean and elegant looks that makes these maps both nice to look at and easy to play on.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The GBACW 4.4 rules that appeared in Gringo! were a major step up for the series in terms of both rules streamlining and presentation. We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree.

13314,"The June 6, 1944 Allied landings in France were an overwhelming success. With more men and material landing each day, the growing power of the American and British forces should have resulted in a drive inland -- but three weeks after the landings, the shallow beachhead had only expanded slightly. There was growing concern that the bloody fighting of the First World War might be repeated.&#10;&#10;British forces should have captured the city of Caen, just 15 kilometers from Gold Beach, on the first or second day of the invasion. British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, faced great pressure to secure the city and tie down German mobile forces while the Americans captured the port of Cherbourg. But a direct attack on the city itself failed at the cost of many Canadian and British lives.&#10;&#10;Next the British attacked west of Caen, where a successful advance might outflank the city and force a German retreat: Operation EPSOM, an attempt to gain by maneuver what could not be taken by assault. British divisions, fresh to war but having trained for years, faced the feared SS troopers of four panzer divisions. Both would soon learn the harsh realities of war in the hedgerows and fields of Normandy.&#10;&#10;Although Montgomery in the end did not force the Germans to abandon Caen itself, he did draw the German armor onto the British Army, who both tied it up and ground it down. The whole purpose of sending I and II SS Panzer Corps to Normandy was to drive the Allies into the sea. Steady British efforts forced the commitment of the armored formations as they arrived on the field and so depleted them that no coordinated German offensive was ever launched.&#10;&#10;Beyond Normandy is a Panzer Grenadier game covering the British operations from the end of June to the middle of July and the German reactions to them. Three maps (two 22&quot; x 34&quot; and one 22&quot; x 17&quot;) depict the actual battlefield at 200 meters a hex and include individual bridges, villages, tracks, roads, hedgerows and church steeples.&#10;&#10;The 583 playing pieces represent leaders, infantry and tank platoons and artillery batteries. They include the weapons employed by British infantry and armored brigades and German SS and Wehrmacht panzer and infantry divisions. New British tank types include the Churchill, Cromwell and Firefly tanks, the flame-throwing Crocodile, and the bomb-throwing AVRE. The Germans bring tough SS grenadiers, Panther tanks and more.&#10;&#10;The game includes 39 scenarios and 5 &quot;super&quot; scenarios (combining two or more of the scenarios into a large-scale operational scenario).&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;",2,180,12,2,180,Panzer Grenadier: Beyond Normandy,180,2004,,"Wargame,World War II","Michael Bennighof,Brian L.

13729,"This game is about the struggle for power and influence in cities by the competing guilds of the age. Players represent one city colour &amp; have a set of tiles in 3 shapes in your colour and a set of cards for each city plus 4 action cards. You play a card and place a tile either from your set or from the church or neutral sets. The starting player also first draws a card from a central deck which effectively gives them an extra move. Tiles of the same colour cannot touch and the church tiles allow cities to expand.&#10;&#10;When a city is completed, it is scored. The colour with the most tiles gets the 1st score, the second colour gets half that, the next gets 4 points and the fourth colour gets 2 pts. Therefore it is possible for the neutral colour to score more points than players. The score is a total of the tiles in the city, plus one for each church, plus one for each cathedral place.&#10;&#10;The action cards let you pick up your discards, place a tile to be fixed later, and go first twice (which are discarded). The draw deck cards can be held to score extra points at the end.&#10;&#10;At first the game seems pedestrian, but within a few turns the possibilities become more obvious. Judicious use of the pick-up and turn order cards make a big difference. Not spreading too widely and using the neutral tiles to devalue other cities also matters.&#10;&#10;An interesting placement game that the designer Wolfgang Panning took 2 1/2 years to complete.

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.&#10;&#10;Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force.

There are 6 types of commodity spread across the 5 continents and players must control these to satisfy two different winning conditions. So to win, you might need to control two tractors and two factories for one condition, and one commodity in each continent for your second condition. Alternately, the first player to earn 1 million wins.&#10;&#10;There are decks of cards; Country (which shows a commodity in a country and a price, e.g. Factories are in Britain and cost 70,000), Yes (good stuff), No (bad stuff), Auftrag (winning conditions). You start with some cash money, a few countries and two Auftrag. For the countries you own, you put the plastic commodity onto your colored disc onto the country. So the player owning Britain puts a factory on one of their discs onto Britain. This way, ownership can be seen and can change.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by two dice. The player rolls them, chooses one for itself and the other for the player on the left to use. The dice are marked Buy, Sell, Country, Yes, No, Cash. Buy means you can buy a commodity/country from another player - regardless of whether they want to sell it - at the price on the card. There is also a red die you can roll to gamble on the price, making it higher or lower. Sell means you may sell a Country back to the bank. Country means you draw a Country card and place the commodity on your disc on it. Yes/No means you draw from the appropriate deck and apply the result, e.g. all players get a dividend, or pay a tax, etc. Cash means you move a marker on the board and whoever has that commodity or continent gets a bonus.&#10;&#10;Since the game is completely driven by two dice, it is pure chance if a good thing or bad thing happens to a player.

14701,"(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;The Price of Freedom: The American Civil War, 1861-65 is Renaud Verlaque's second published design after Age of Napoleon, winner of 2003 Best Pre-WW2 Historical Boardgame CSR award.&#10;&#10;The Price of Freedom is a true grand-strategic-level look at the American Civil War. Using an original card-driven system, it provides strong historical flavor in a simple game that can consistently be played in three hours. This makes The Price of Freedom an ideal game for today's gamer's busy lifestyle, as well as for tournaments.&#10;&#10;As you might expect from a quick-playing game, counter density in The Price of Freedom is purposefully low and is also constrained by each side&rsquo;s War Effort level, an aggregate measure of economic, political and diplomatic support for the war. Each military game piece represents a &quot;corps&quot; of 20-30,000 men. Corps must organized into armies led by the colorful commanders that every American Civil War aficionado has come to love or hate. Twenty-five historical army commanders are available for theater or field command, from Ben &quot;Spoons&quot; Butler to &quot;Massa&quot; Robert E. Lee, with each commander rated -1, 0 or +1 for offense, defense and movement.  Armies move and fight on a functional and yet very attractive point-to-point representation of the Eastern and Western theaters, vying to capture or defend critical territory or simply to beat each other out.&#10;&#10;The card-driven engine ensures that no game of The Price of Freedom is ever the same as another and that there are plenty of hard choices to make in each campaign impulse. The game uses a well-balanced deck of 55 cards that are all playable by both sides. Each card has two uses that are generally mutually exclusive: either it can be used by spending its operational value (ranging 1-3) on various actions (moving, reorganizing or reinforcing armies) or it can be used to implement the event described on the card. Events can affect army leadership (Commander-in-Chief, Clash of Egos, Shot from the Saddle) or battle resolution (Blundering Fool; Seeing the Elephant; Bickering Generals; etc.), help gain operational advantage (Strategic Transfer; Turning Movement; Interior Lines), or simulate major political, economic or diplomatic events (Draft; Kentucky; Blockade; etc.). Like overall army size, hand size is dictated by each side's War Effort level.&#10;&#10;The Union player can win by driving down the Confederate War Effort level low enough or by vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. The Confederate player can win in similar fashion or by hanging long and well enough to cause Lincoln to lose the 1864 elections or prevent the Union player from achieving the historical outcome.&#10;&#10;So convene your cabinet, call up your generals, muster your troops, it is time to fight and find out what is the true Price of Freedom!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website:)Components:&#10;    1 25&quot;x19&quot; cardstock map&#10;    132 counters&#10;    1 deck of 55 playing cards&#10;    2 player-aid cards&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    2 6-sided dice&#10;    1 full color box and lid&#10;&#10;",2,120,12,2,120,The Price of Freedom: The American Civil War 1861-1865,120,2008,"Brien J.

Will you go for broke with an all-in-bet?&#10;&#10;At showdown time, the player with the best poker hand wins the chips.

Dice combinations are similar to their poker counterparts and can give players; two pair, three of a kind, full house, straight, four of a kind, flush, Yahtzee (five dice of the same number in different suits), straight flush, and the &quot;Yahtzee Flush&quot; - five dice of the same number and suit (color), that automatically wins a player the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Components&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rules&#10;    20 6-sided dice (in 4 &quot;suits&quot; of red, white, yellow and black)&#10;    Cloth draw bag&#10;    6 plastic dice rolling cups&#10;    90 plastic poker chips (in 10, 50, &amp; 100 denominations)&#10;&#10;&#10;",6,30,18,2,30,Yahtzee: Texas Hold'em,30,2004,,Dice,(Uncredited),"Poker,Yahtzee",Betting/Wagering,"Hasbro,Parker Brothers",5.20246,224,2-3

The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows).

This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower). Since the regions can only get more valuable, this ensures many agonizing decisions.&#10;&#10;(From Gamewire and Spielbox)&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;",5,30,8,2,30,Carcassonne: The Discovery,30,2005,"Stefano Mondini,Fabio Visintin",Strategy,"Leo Colovini,Klaus-Jürgen Wrede",Carcassonne,Tile Placement,"999 Games,Albi,Funagain,Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,Hobby World,Piatnik,Rio Grande Games,Smart Ltd,Venice Connection",6.50899,1918,2-3

Their exploits and charisma made them famous, and their story has been made into books and movies. Ted Hinton was the FBI agent charged with capturing them.&#10;&#10;You are an FBI agent competing against other agents to see who can catch Bonnie and Clyde. The object of the game is to be the first to score 100 or more points.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards used in this game: Evidence (Location) cards and the Ted Hinton card. The game is played like the classic Rummy card game, with players playing melds and layoffs of Evidence cards to score points. The Ted Hinton card adds a strategic element to the game not found in traditional Rummy. After each hand, you total your points, and if no one has 100 or more points, you play another hand.&#10;&#10;",4,45,8,2,45,Bonnie and Clyde,45,2009,"Martin Hoffmann,Claus Stephan",Card,Mike Fitzgerald,"Mystery Rummy,Rummy Games","Hand Management,Set Collection","ABACUSSPIELE,Rio Grande Games",6.30087,554,2-3

16500,"Take charge of your clan from the Scottish high country. In each round, a player first builds up his clan and landholdings, and then optionally conducts a raid on an opponent.&#10;&#10;You start by pulling six cubes from a bag. With green cubes you increase your ministers and potential to gain VPs at the end of a round. Yellow cubes attract warriors and permit you to hold more battle cards. The blue cubes are &quot;pipers&quot; used for combat support or possible VP generation. A blue cube can also be played as a &quot;bard&quot; to lure away opponents' followers. Finally, there are the red cubes, which represent cattle and generate VPs. You also use cubes to create new estates, where you can deposit cattle and groups of cubes (which are safer than those not on an estate).&#10;&#10;Raids are resolved simply. In three battle-rounds a card of value one to four is played by the two opponents; this value can be increased by a single blue cube. The one who wins the most battle-rounds wins the fight. The loser will then lose cubes while the victor gains a VP or two.&#10;&#10;After each round there is a valuation, in which the VPs are determined based on number of cubes. For example, the player with the most green cubes gets 3 VPs, while second most gets 2 VPs; if two players are tied for most, each gets only 1 VP. Another example: each red cattle tile is worth a VP, but if one player has the most he gets a 2 VP bonus.&#10;&#10;The estate tiles contain a number on the back. After each round a panel is turned. If the leading player has at least as many points as the number of the tile, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Bottom line: a fast game offering something for everyone: luck, tactics, and lots of interaction with your fellow players.&#10;&#10;",5,60,8,3,45,Highland Clans,60,2005,Hans-Jörg Brehm,Strategy,Ralf Burkert,Country: Scotland,Tile Placement,Queen Games,5.63987,316,2-3

18098,"(From the publisher)&#10;&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44&quot; x 34&quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.&#10;&#10;From Back of Box&#10;On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.&#10;&#10;The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.

Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider and headquarters units are all fully represented. The four maps are an accurate representation of the region. Compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-44 1:50,000 US Army maps, they shows all roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with all the towns and villages that became bastions of the American defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn&rsquo;t be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.&#10;&#10;PLAYERS may use single maps for six smaller scenarios. There is also a campaign game that utilizes all four sections and portrays three weeks  (50 game turns).

Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.&#10;&#10;THIS edition of Wacht am Rhein presents modifications to the combat, artillery and supply systems of the first edition in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare. For example, an &ldquo;exploitation mode&rdquo; has been added in order to allow mechanized units to take advantage of breakthroughs in the enemy line. Other changes include the addition of &ldquo;vantage points,&rdquo; which function as high ground, enabling units to spot more effectively for artillery, as well as &ldquo;constricted terrain,&rdquo; which represents the channeling caused by steep gullies and ravines.&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;     Map: 1 mile per hex&#10;     Time: 3 Game Turns per day&#10;     Units: Infantry and Artillery units are battalions.

Your travel office asks you to explore new holiday destinations. Your task is to find the best beaches and the most attractive locations.&quot;&#10;&#10;Aloha is a nice mix of tile play and push-your-luck. Players are travel reps trying to secure the best beaches by placing sun loungers on beaches as they explore the island. The tiles show a good mix of land and water, with 1-3 golden beaches on most tiles. On your turn, you jump your rep to a new place, then draw a tile. This must be placed adjacent so you can walk straight onto it, otherwise your turn is over. If you walk on, and it has a beach, you have the option of dropping a lounger in your color onto it on its side.&#10;&#10;Then you can decide to push your luck and draw another tile. Each time you walk on, you may drop another lounger, but these go onto their sides. When you decide you've done enough or cannot move on anyway, you stop drawing and turn your loungers upright. But if you draw a tile you can't place so that you walk on, you lose all the loungers on their sides back to your pot. The tile still gets placed, and the game has a clever rule. Whenever a tile is placed, it must go where it touches the most tiles. So if the tile is going next to where you stand, sometimes you have no choice, the game forces its placement. But usually you have a few choices and these are crucial to pushing your luck.&#10;&#10;Finally, when all the tiles are down, the island is scored. The longest beach gets a 10pt marker, the next a 9pt marker and so on (with rules for tie-breaks). Then, the player with the most loungers on that beach collects to points markers (more tie-breaks). Also, any loungers still in your pot are also worth 1 pt each.&#10;&#10;At first, you think you must fight over owning beaches, and try to wrest back control of a beach. But in fact you will only win by occupying several beaches, and often you only need 3 or 4 markers to secure control. Being able to start a beach, get control, then extend it to get most points will win. Players can be unlucky and draw un-walkable tiles a few times, but this means you are not picking the correct places when jumping.&#10;&#10;As the game ends, your options reduce, but you should have done your work already. The result is a nice looking island, with lush jungle and bluewater inlets, dotted with lots of loungers.&#10;&#10;You have nothing to do till your turn, but if you make the right choices, you should have a winning chance. Knowing when to go one more tile matters, and knowing when to stop. Players with lots of loungers left in front of them can still win, but may have wasted their opportunities.&#10;&#10;",5,45,10,2,45,Aloha,45,2005,Marten Scheeren,Strategy,Corné van Moorsel,Tropical theme,"Press Your Luck,Tile Placement",Cwali,5.4553,132,2-3
20053,"Red Vengeance is a sequel to Defiant Russia. Like that game, it is designed to be easy to learn and fun. The map portrays the western Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Romania and eastern Germany, with parts of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria as well.&#10;&#10;Players control the actual units that fought in this campaign. Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Romanian units; the latter two will eventually switch sides. The Axis player actually starts the game with more tank units, the real striking power in this game, than the Soviets. But as they&rsquo;re lost they are difficult to replace, while Soviet power just keeps surging.&#10;&#10;Like Defiant Russia, Red Vengeance isn't a very large game. The 17x22-inch map fits easily on a small table. There are 140 playing pieces, and it comes in a small box that's easy to store. The game plays very quickly, concluding in about 90 minutes, with a minimum of charts and tables to consult.&#10;&#10;",2,180,0,2,180,Red Vengeance,180,2005,,"Wargame,World War II",William Sariego,Avalanche Press WWII Battles Series,"Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter",Avalanche Press Ltd.,6.32181,94,2-3
20054,"By the winter of 1942, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants had contained the German attacks of the previous summer and fall. Now came the time for a whole series of counter-offensive of its own, designed to cut off and destroy the weakened Nazi armies.&#10;&#10;The northernmost of these would be Operation &quot;Mars&quot;, aimed at the German Ninth Army around the city of Rzhev, west of Moscow in the winter of 1942. The Soviet plan, the work of the brilliant Marshal Georgi Zhukov, called for smashing the already-weakened Germans with a heavy commitment of tanks and fresh troops. When this first objective had been reached, a second operation, code-named Jupiter, would encircle and destroy the German 3rd Panzer Army to the south.&#10;&#10;Despite horrible weather and very rough forested terrain, the initial Soviet attacks went very well. But German resistance stiffened, and as the Red Army failed to make further progress Zhukov reacted by committing more and more men and tanks. Suicidal courage only added to the Soviet casualty lists, and by the time the offensive sputtered to a halt Soviet losses topped 335,000 men and 1,600 tanks.&#10;Little known thanks to Soviet government silence for 50 years, the offensive was designed as a companion to the &quot;Saturn&quot; offensive around Stalingrad. The fact that the offensive was repulsed with heavy losses meant it was not discussed in Soviet accounts of the Great Patriotic War. While the offensive failed to accomplish what the Soviet High Command and General Georgi Zhukov wished, it did provide what the Soviets needed most, a means of keeping German forces of Army Group Center in place while the Saturn offensive in the south ran its course.&#10;&#10;Red God of War covers Operation Mars using the same game system as Alsace 1945 and America Triumphant. Game pieces represent regiments, brigades and divisions. Headquarters are vital to activate units and send them into action; supply is also important to keeping your units at full efficiency and players must choose how to allocate their resources. There will never be enough of them to accomplish everything at once.&#10;&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 5 miles (8 kilometers) &#10;Units: Battalion to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 16-page Red God of War rulebook&#10;    One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Good&#10;Complexity Level: 1,5 out of 5&#10;Players: 2&#10;Playing Time: 60 to 120 minutes&#10;&#10;(Source: Avalanche Press website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",2,120,14,2,120,"Red God of War: The Soviet Operation Mars, 1942",120,2005,"Shannon Brown,Shane Ivey,Terry Moore Strickland","Wargame,World War II",Brian L.

20077,"Kutuzov is an interactive, play it complete in one-sitting card-driven game of sweeping manoeuvres, epic battles, storied sieges, lethal attrition and crucial-to-win troop morale for one to four players from the designer of The Napoleonic Wars and Wellington.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1812 Emperor Napoleon of France gathered the regiments of 20 nations together into the largest military force yet raised in Europe. That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail KUTUZOV.&#10;&#10;Kutuzov uses the same basic rules system as found in The Napoleonic Wars, as it has been modified for even more interactive play in Wellington . As with the later title, there are no diplomatic or political rules: other than those which come into play should Imperial morale fall so low as to trigger the desertion of the Austrians or outright revolt of the Prussians. There are no naval rules other than a Russian ability to move between friendly ports and a &quot;Hornblower&quot; Home Card that allows for a Russian invasion on the Baltic Coast). Kutuzov is thus primarily a game of manoeuvre and combat, where players can recreate the sieges and legendary battles made so familiar to gamers as brought to life in such great books as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.&#10;&#10;As this is Russia, however, not all enemies stand in solid ranks before you. Players must contend not only with their opponents but with Cossack raiders, Polish Lancers, often brutally horrifying attrition, fragile morale, treacherous allies, political events from outside the theatre of war and, of course, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;General Winter&quot; himself, whose scourge effects both invader and defender of Holy Mother Russia.&#10;&#10;110 Cards, most with quotes from the actual participants in that great struggle, drive the game and bring to it the flavour of being in Russia during the 1812 Campaign. The Imperials and Tsarists each have mini- &quot;Home Decks&quot; of a dozen cards each to share, thus increasing the chance that events, forces and options that were presented to the original contenders will arise during play. The other 86 cards, which include many &quot;Must Play&quot; political events, however, ensure every playing of the game will be very different.&#10;&#10;Kutuzov comes with a campaign game that can last one, two, three or four turns - but which includes numerous mechanisms that can bring the game to a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; ending at the conclusion of or even DURING A TURN.&#10;&#10;Mark and Fred, in seeking to deliver more value, variation and enjoyable gaming have provided two other game start scenarios which allow for the game to begin at the commencement of what would be turn two (On to Smolensk!) or turn three (Napoleon in Moscow) of the campaign. A fourth and rather unique method of play allows for two players to each take ONE of the powers from EACH side, in a highly competitive and unusual game of labyrinthine think and double-think. A fifth version allows for two players to play the game using a SINGLE hand of cards each, with &quot;chips&quot; to buy additional cards for their side as the play progresses.&#10;&#10;The Campaign and the Scenarios:&#10;&#10;&quot;Invasion&quot;: A Turn One game start should see the French and their Allies' military juggernaut smash across the border and attempt to catch and annihilate the Russians before they can mass to defend their Motherland Can the players surpass their historical counterparts?&#10;&#10;&quot;On to Smolensk !&quot;: This permits players to avoid the border battles and initial French advances to begin play at a watershed of the Campaign: The Grand Army confronting concentrated Russian forces defending Smolensk immediately before Kutuzov arrives to take command. Will the French advance on Moscow as they did historically or seek victory through an alternative offensive direction&hellip;north to St. Petersberg or south to seize the Ukraine and other southern victory points?&#10;&#10;&quot;Napoleon in Moscow&quot;: In this version of Kutuzov the bloody Battle of Borodino has been fought. The Grand Army reposes in Moscow awaiting Russian surrender or at least agreement to terms. The first chill snow of Winter has fallen, harbinger what's to come: should the French remain deep in Russia hoping to conquer the country or is it time to withdraw to better defences for the 1813 Campaign?&#10;&#10;In all of the scenarios, the Imperial Powers have an initial advantage in numbers, leadership, Resources, and Morale. They are, after all, an Army that has never known defeat; a superb military instrument, led by the most powerful man in Europe with his devoted retinue of almost legendary Marshals. They face an enemy who has not tasted victory in Battle in nearly a generation, let alone full-scale war of the likes of which Napoleon wages. &#10;The French must take advantage of their superiority quickly, as that will soon dissipate in the immense marshes, unending steppes and fiercely fought over fields and cities of Russia. If they do not or can not succeed, then the advantage slips away to the forces of the Tsar, who, under Kutuzov, will not just be defending Russia, but will be advancing into the outer marches of that yet fragile empire led by their archenemy&hellip; Napoleon.&#10;&#10;",4,360,12,2,360,Kutuzov,360,2008,"Rodger B.

20133,"The Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series - Volume 1: The Bulge&#10;&#10;From Rick Young, designer of Europe Engulfed, comes a series of fun, tense block games. FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.&#10;&#10;Volume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.&#10;&#10;FAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. &#10;&#10;&#10;Another strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play. Special Actions give you tense choices in deciding how and when to seize initiative or interfere with a sudden move by your opponent.&#10;&#10;Series Designer: Rick Young&#10;Series Developer: John Foley&#10;Published: 2007&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wargameroom (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,240,12,2,240,FAB: The Bulge,240,2008,"Rodger B.

20266,"Bitter End: Attack to Budapest, 1945, is an operational-level simulation of the German attempts to relieve the encircled Hungarian capital of Budapest, besieged by Soviet forces, in January 1945.&#10;&#10;Budapest, Hungary, January 1945&#10;&#10;79,000 Axis troops belonging to the IX SS Mountain and 1st Hungarian Corps are surrounded and being pounded by two Soviet armies, the 46th and 7th Guards. The situation is grim. The Soviets are well- supported by heavy artillery and the German line has been steadily retreating, leaving Budapest in grave danger.&#10;&#10;On January 1st, the German IV SS and III Panzer Corps launch a surprise attack to rescue the defenders and recapture the city. By January 12th the attack is stalled in the rough terrain to the west of the city. Hitler shifts the focus of the attack from the west to the south-west and continues the attack on January 18th. Although progress is made, Soviet reinforcements pour into the area and the offensive grinds to a halt.&#10;&#10;Hitler calls off the attack at the end of January, and by February 14th, after seven weeks of grueling combat, Budapest falls.&#10;&#10;&#10;By January of 1945 Nazi Germany_s military fate was sealed. There was nothing the German forces in Hungary could have achieved that could have substantially delayed or even mitigated this defeat. That did not deter the German attempt to relieve Budapest. Hitler_s goal in ordering the attack toward Budapest was not the rescue of its garrison, but rather the recapture and retention of the city. The garrison was in fact ordered not to break out but instead to hold and await relief. Few commanders on the German side took the idea of the retention of Budapest seriously, however. Had the relieving German forces gotten to within a few miles of the city, a breakout attempt would probably have been made. Bitter End lets the players explore the tantalizing possibilities. In addition, players may test their skills with several viable historical alternatives, such as the inclusion of forces that could have been available to the respective commanders.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (456 9/16&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Bitter End rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed Unit Organizational Charts&#10;Two dual-side printed Historical Set-up Charts&#10;Three dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-25 hours&#10;&#10;",2,240,12,1,240,"Bitter End: Attack to Budapest, 1945",240,2005,Todd Davis,"Wargame,World War II",Richard Spence,"Cities: Budapest,Country: Hungary","Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Simulation",Compass Games,7.35922,116,2-3

20545,"Here's a game that's enormous fun and will sharpen your wits and hone your imagination. The 54 images were designed by Rory O'Connor of Ireland, a trainer in creativity and creative problem-solving. They can be used to arrive at answers or decisions in an indirect and ingenious way.&#10;&#10;Originally Rory had put the images on the faces of a Rubik's Cube, and players would turn the Cube to scramble the images, then choose one side to play with. Kate Jones of Kadon Enterprises suggested putting the 54 images on 9 separate cubes, to allow for quicker ways to generate more varied combinations, including conceptual puzzles. Rory readily agreed, having considered the 9-cubes idea himself earlier. At a creativity conference held at Kadon headquarters in May 2004, a prototype was whipped up, and in 2005 Kadon launched the cubes version of Rory's Story Cubes.&#10;&#10;Each jumbo 1&quot; cube has 6 images or icons, with a total of 54 all-different hand-inlaid images that can be mixed in over 10 million ways. You roll all 9 cubes to generate 9 random images and then use these to invent a story that starts with &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; and uses all 9 elements as part of your narrative.&#10;&#10;Play it as a game for one or more players, or as a party game for three or more. Or play it as an improv game where each player contributes part of the story, picking up where the last one left off. Win award points for speedy delivery, inventiveness, imagination, drama and humor.&#10;&#10;Full instructions include several other ways to use the cubes to solve problems, break up writer's block, enhance your imagination and heighten your ability to find unifying themes among the diverse images. Interpret or get at the meanings of your answers more quickly. It's fun, easy, and mind-stretching.&#10;&#10;As a puzzle the cubes will really give your imagination a work-out. You'll practically feel both sides of your brain dancing. The challenge: Fit the 9 cubes into a 3x3 square. Now examine the cubes in any one row and turn them so their tops have something in common. Do this for all 3 rows. Explain your choices, or challenge another player to identify the element they share. More than one answer may be right, and there are thousands of possible combinations.&#10;&#10;Rory's Story Cubes are recommended for all ages over 8, though it's fun to watch a younger child create combinations with the cubes and make up stories.&#10;&#10;",12,20,8,1,20,Rory's Story Cubes,20,2005,Rory O'Connor,Dice,Rory O'Connor,Rory's Story Cubes,"Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Pattern Recognition,Storytelling","Brain Games,The Creativity Hub,Gamewright,Gém Klub Kft.,Gigamic,HUCH! & friends,Kadon Enterprises,MINDOK,REBEL.pl",6.38367,1957,2-3

20821,"In Tara each player strives to become Ard Ri or High King of Ireland.  Through the play of cards representing your supporters and the use of 'cumals' (a cumal is worth three cows), you attempt to promote your followers from Farmers to Herdsmen, through Warriors to Chieftains and finally to the ruling King in the region.&#10;&#10;Tara is played in rounds of three cards.  A round is completed when each player has used three cards.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game the Starting Player deals each player six cards.  Each player chooses three of these cards to use in round one, and puts aside the remaining three cards - you will use the second set of three cards in round two.&#10;&#10;In your turn, you select and play one card from your hand.  Then the player on your left takes a turn, and so on, until each player has played all three of their cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When you play a card, you choose one of four actions:&#10;A    Place pieces into a region;&#10;B    Play a Stone of Destiny card to swap 2 pieces in a region;&#10;C    Discard the card and pay 4 cumals to declare an amnesty that releases all captives from a region;&#10;D    Discard the card to gain 2 cumals.&#10;&#10;If you placed or swapped pieces, you may pay the card's Activation Cost to promote from two of your adjacent pieces to the space immediately above them.  For example, if you placed a herdsman next to another of your herdsmen, you could pay the Activation Cost and put a piece above both herdsmen into the space at the warrior level.  The object is to gain a King in the region by promoting to the King space.&#10;&#10;By placing or promoting pieces you might capture opposing pieces and release those of your own that have been previously captured.&#10;&#10;After each player has played the three cards in hand, there is an End of Round sequence.  Each region may have a traitor.  The player who owns the traitor swaps one of their pieces for an opponent's piece and may then pay to promote from the traitor's space.  Once all traitors have been actioned, players collect income, dependent on the number of pieces they have on the board and their rank.  Then remove pieces from any region containing a new King; the player with the new King establishes a garrison in the region, captives are removed and exchange or ransom of prisoners may occur.  Finally the Starting Player chooses a new Starting Player for the next round.  A new round then begins, using the three cards set aside by each player if they remain, or by dealing another six cards to each player and splitting them into two sets of three as at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has a King in two different regions.&#10;&#10;",4,45,10,2,45,"Tara, Seat of Kings",45,2006,"Tony Boydell,Charlie Paull",Strategy,Alan Paull,,Hand Management,Surprised Stare Games Ltd,6.28793,164,2-3

21050,"Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible.

There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters).

The snakes' frenzy bring them to run between the trees and players must me able to &quot;pilot&quot; them to the apples, avoiding mushrooms, trees and the other snakes. The game is card driven (the cards are describe the possible movements).&quot;&#10;&#10;SnakeLake is a cross between the old computer game Snake and the board game Robo Rally, but is much simpler and faster than RR. You have a simple board with a grid and place some apple trees around, then each player chooses a starting point.&#10;&#10;Each player uses cards to program their next three moves in secret on their own chart, with the 2nd and 3rd move sliding down each turn when the 1st card is used and a new card going in the 3rd slot. The cards simply show forward, left, right (twice each) and one stop card. They also tell you to draw an Event card, which add some randomness.&#10;&#10;If your snake runs into a tree, or off the board when incomplete, or into another snake's body, you start over again somewhere else, reprogramming your next three snake moves. If you hit another snake's head, they go off and you score a point for each segment of their body. If you get your whole snake on the board and then get your head off the board, you score points for the length of your snake.&#10;&#10;But the big points come from eating apples which fall from the apple trees. These have 8-12 points on them, and your snake runs over them to eat them and reveal the points scored. Likewise, there are some mushrooms which deduct points if eaten. The apples and mushrooms are placed when an Event card indicates. The other events include removing an apple, sending an opponent's snake to sleep (miss a turn), and make your snake's body longer or shorter.&#10;&#10;Snake Lake is a light, fast, fun game and will suit children more than adult's. The best strategy seems to be eat an apple then get knocked off the board to start somewhere else, near more apples. Getting your whole snake on and off is hard work, and scores few points in comparison.&#10;&#10;The components are nicely made, good shiny cards that should wear well.

22198,"This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished.&#10;&#10;The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score.&#10;&#10;",5,30,10,2,30,Great Wall of China,30,2006,"Ted Nasmith,Marek Szyszko",Card,Reiner Knizia,"Asian Theme,Country: China,Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games","Area Control / Area Influence,Hand Management","999 Games,Devir,Egmont Polska,Fantasy Flight Games,KOSMOS,Laser plus",6.2293,1803,2-3

There are three shapes in three colors, 54 tiles total, one shape per tile. The board is a tilted easel; you slide your tile down one of the 7 grooves till it reaches the lowest available spot. After that it can't be moved. The four-in-a-row may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. The trick is to concentrate on your objective (color or shape) while keeping an eye on what your move does for your opponent.

22457,"From Avalonhill web site:&#10;&#10;German tanks thunder into the snow-covered Ardennes forest, opposed only by a few unsuspecting divisions of exhausted American troops. As Axis forces plunge into the countryside, Allied troops must struggle to hold the front line in order to repel the all-out offensive. Axis &amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge challenges you to control territory and contend with supply shortages, while directing infantry, artillery, tanks, and aircraft in one of the most decisive conflicts of World War II.&#10;&#10;Scheduled for release in November, 2006, Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge will feature detailed game components including a new truck piece, a hex-based game board with new original artwork, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the Battle of the Bulge game box. Other elements of this new Axis &amp; Allies variant include crucial elements that were key factors in the historical battle, such as supply shortages and late-battle air support, mechanics for overland vs. road movement and randomized casualties of war&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies depicts Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhein), the German code name for this counteroffensive that took place toward the end of World War II. The objective: to capture the port city of Antwerp. It was expected that the capture of Antwerp would cause a great disruption in the flow of Allied supplies, and also have the effect of breaking apart the great Anglo-American alliance.&#10;&#10;One player controls Germany, whose massive build up of forces have gone undetected by the Allies and are poised to unleash all their fury on the Allies. The other player controls the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States and they must stem the tide of German armor and hold their positions until reinforcements arrive.&#10;&#10;Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is designed for two players and can be played in three to four hours. Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is the fourth Axis &amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis &amp; Allies D-Day, Axis &amp; Allies Europe and Axis &amp; Allies Pacific versions.

22484,"It's Einfach Genial/Ingenious in a 2-player travel version.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hex board. 57 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that makes up the piece (sometimes identical symbols). The pieces are drawn randomly in the game. Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colours. Points are claimed by placing a piece into any open space such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol. So, for example, if a player places a piece with a purple circle on it such that it sits next to an unbroken line of four other purple circles already on the board, then the player scores four purple points. A newly placed symbol can lie next to at most five individual rows of symbols.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a scoring track to keep track of his points &ndash; one track for each colour going from 0 to 18. If a player reaches the 18th space with any colour, then he gets to call out &ldquo;Genial!&rdquo; and take another turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of their turn, players draw as many tiles out of the bag as required to bring their rack back up to six.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board. Now each player looks to see how many points they scored in the colour they scored the least in. Whoever has the most points in their least-scored colour is the winner.&#10;&#10;In the full game, there are 5 of each double and 6 of each pair of colors, the travel edition has 2 of each double and 3 of each pair.&#10;&#10;Einfach Genial - Reiseedition is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",2,30,10,2,30,Ingenious: Travel Edition,30,2006,Michaela Kienle,Strategy,Reiner Knizia,"Ingenious,Kosmos two-player series","Hand Management,Pattern Building,Tile Placement","Bard Centrum Gier,Fantasy Flight Games,Green Board Game Co.,KOSMOS,Lautapelit.fi,Sophisticated Games",7.14462,1732,2-3

22677,"From Ted Raicer the award-winning designer of Paths of Glory and World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin comes a fresh new look at the most titanic and brutal land campaign ever waged, the war between Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;Stalin's War is a unique card-driven, hex-based game, a combination that allows players to experience a broad range of strategic and tactical options as they maneuver their forces across a large hex map that stretches from Berlin to the Urals.&#10;&#10;Stalin's War allows player to recreate WWII's greatest battles of encirclement as Axis Armies and Panzer Corps clash with Soviet Fronts and Armies on a front a thousand miles wide. Simple but effective rules allow you to use your mechanized forces to blitz the enemy's front line and exploit deep into your opponent's rear. Can you as the Soviets survive the slashing Panzer attacks of Operation Barbarossa and Case Blue in 1941 and 1942? Can you as the Axis player stand against the crushing Soviet Deep Battle operations that destroyed Army Group Center in 1944? Stalin's War will test both player's operational skills to the limit.&#10;&#10;But there is more to Stalin's War than directing your forces on the map. Both sides have their own deck of 55 cards, needed to launch offensive operations, mobilize their forces, replace losses, introduce new weapons, and deal with the larger strategic context of a World at War. Card Events include combat leaders, weapons (from German Tiger Tanks to patriotic Soviet mice nibbling the electrical wiring of the panzers), the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, Manstein's Backhand Blow, Stalin's and Hitler's meddling, the Battle of the Bulge, and much more.&#10;&#10;Stalin's War allows players to combine the best of WWII operational play with the strategic depth and tactical chrome of a card driven design.

23917,"&quot;June 3. Cold Harbor. I was killed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Thus read the last diary entry, found in the pocket of a dead Union soldier. He had made the entry himself, while all around him, other soldiers were writing names and home addresses on slips of paper and pinning them to the back of their coats.&#10;&#10;These veteran soldiers knew what was coming, although it seems their commanders did not. Three full corps launched a disjointed attack against well-entrenched Confederates. In just eight minutes, the attack had petered out. Over 7000 Federals covered the Virginia soil. A few minutes later, the orders came down to renew the attacks, but at each level, from corps commander to captain, the orders were &quot;followed&quot; only by increased firing -- most of it blindly -- while remaining in position.&#10;&#10;Grant said, &quot;I regret this assault more than any one I ever ordered.&quot; Today it sounds more like WWI madness than part of Grant's successful campaign to end the Civil War.&#10;&#10;But it was not so easy on the other side. While one CSA staffer called it &quot;perhaps the easiest victory ever granted to Confederate arms by the folly of Federal commanders,&quot; from Lee's point of view, anything could happen. His army had &quot;not a regiment&quot; in reserve, and the volume of sound -- &quot;It seemed more like a volcanic blast than a battle,&quot; -- rattled windows all the way back in Richmond.&#10;&#10;Not War But Murder covers the week-long operation which marked the end of Grant's 30 day, &quot;smash 'em up&quot; campaign begun at Wilderness. Like a bloody chess match, Grant and Lee made move and counter move to get to this point, with Lee well aware that a false move could end the war quickly.&#10;&#10;Not War But Murder, by designer Michael Rinella, is his newest area-map game, and his first take on an American Civil War battle. This game includes one 22&quot; by 34&quot; inch area map, 176 5/8&quot; counters, and 16 pages of rules and charts that include extensive examples of play, designer notes, and variant rules. It also marks the debut of what Rinella calls the &quot;diceless advantage&quot;. In previous area-impulse games, from Monty's Gamble all the way to the Avalon Hill games of the early 1990s, an &quot;advantage chit&quot; allowed the person holding it to re-roll an single die roll (or rolls if it was a combat).

23928,"(from GMT web site :)&#10;&#10;Glory III is the third game in GMT's popular American Civil War series, Glory. This series presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play combined with solid historical insight. Glory III follows the success of Glory II: Across the Rappahannock, and presents a polished system with ease of play, with two combat-intensive one-map battles. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.&#10;&#10;Glory III features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Both battles have special command problems and some new and interesting mechanics to allow the players to play within the framework of those conditions.&#10;&#10;Antietam, one of the major battles of the war, makes great use of the Glory activation system, linking the Union/McClellan command problems directly to its use. But it still allows the player to make choices, choices different from those Little Mac made, perhaps changing the course of the battle.&#10;&#10;Cedar Creek is a great momentum battle, with an initial, probably highly effective Confederate surprise attack followed by the return of General Phil Sheridan to the battlefield, the arrival of George Custer's repeater-armed cavalry, and, hopefully for the Union Player, enough of a counter-attack to snatch victory from Jubal Early's rapidly munching jaws. Has Jubal bitten off more than he can chew? Grab your wallet, roll the die and find out!&#10;&#10;Designed gloriously by Richard H Berg, Developed with consummate skill and dedication by a new star on the industry horizon, Jim Dauphinais, playtested to a fine edge, and featuring the usual eye-popping, drool-inducing GMT graphics, Glory III is the best game yet in the Glory series.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 22 x 34 backprinted map&#10;     2 counter sheets&#10;     Rulebook&#10;     1 die&#10;     Player Aid Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;Designer: Richard Berg&#10;Developer: Jim Dauphinais&#10;&#10;Game 3 in the GMT Glory Civil War game series. This series features battles recreated at the Brigade level with each game in the series featuring 2 battles from the Civil War. In this edition of the series the two battles are Antietam and Cedar Creek.&#10;&#10;The Glory system features a unique chit activation mechanic. This results in players unsure of when or if a certain field commander will carry out your orders. The game system is designed for playability over bookkeeping. The main rules are only 12 pages long.  Scenarios run from 2 hours for Burnside's late afternoon attack at Antietam, up to 6 hours for Cedar Creek and up to 12 hours for the full battle of Antietam (if it needs to go the distance for a decision).&#10;&#10;",2,240,12,1,240,Glory III,240,2007,"Rodger B.

There are six tricks, with the winner gaining positive or negative points for each trick.

26250,"On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.&#10;&#10;The  opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.&#10;&#10;From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.&#10;&#10;To the Barricades!, the first title in the War Storms series, is a game which attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually happened.&#10;&#10;",2,120,12,2,120,A las Barricadas!,120,2006,Nicolás Eskubi,Strategy,"Juan Carlos Cebrián,Nicolás Eskubi",War Storms Series,"Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Simulation",War Storm Series,7.08561,66,2-3

CC:P's main theme is the addition of three new factions to the Combat Commander family:&#10;&#10;    Imperial Japan&#10;    the Pacific US - with a strong emphasis on the US Marine Corps&#10;    the Pacific Commonwealth - focusing on Indian and ANZAC forces&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CC:P is a stand alone game in the card-driven Combat Commander game series. While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe's basic rules, CC:P includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This slightly ramps up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism. Just a few of the additions include:&#10;&#10;Banzai attacks;&#10;BARs and Thompson SMGs;&#10;Beach landings &amp; river crossings;&#10;Hidden movement;&#10;Caves;&#10;Scouts;&#10;Aircraft;&#10;Bayonets;&#10;Mortar spotting;&#10;Treetop snipers;&#10;Reconnoitering.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet across (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Turn abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete Game Turn abstractly represents several minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;UNITS: Due in part to the unique composition of late-war USMC squads and the imbedding of specialized weapon teams within IJA squads, the units in the game are represented by 4-6 man Teams and 8-13 man Squads. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a rifle &mdash; are represented by their own counters. Individual Aircraft are also represented with their own counters.&#10;&#10;VICTORY: Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;GAME FLOW: A game of Combat Commander is divided into several Time segments. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; and die roll &quot;Triggers&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;CC:P includes twelve maps featuring terrain specific to the PTO.&#10;&#10;CC:P's playbook includes:&#10;&#10;    twelve scenarios.&#10;    Pacific version of the Random Scenario Generator utilizing the new maps and nationalities.

It started before the birth of Christ (B.C.) and lasted, in the East, until year 476 A.D. (anno domini) and, in the West, until 1453 A.D. Let us go back to year 140 D.C., when this Empire reached its greatest extension and dominated practically all Europe, part of Asia and northern Africa. Times that were not completely peaceful, for enemies threatened the borders of the empire and the conquered people insurrected against domination, seeking freedom. Go back in time with War: Roman Empire and feel the thrill of defending your borders and advancing your legions, conquering provinces of the roman world in 140 A.D.! Observe, though, that the political division of the provinces adopted in the board objectives to ease the game mechanics, and not portrait the reality of that age. All province and sea names are written in latin. Only the region names are in portuguese. Each players is dealt an objective, that will only be known by himself. The knowledge of this objective by other players will make your conquest harder.

For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment.

The Soviets begin with seemingly overwhelming force, while the Germans trade space for time and attempt to rush reinforcements to the front to plug inevitable gaps. While the Germans are primarily on the defense, careful counter-attacks against the relatively immobile Soviet formations can prove to be key to victory.

This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;&#10;     Three 22 x 34 inch maps&#10;     One 24 x 34 inch map&#10;     1120 counters&#10;     Series rule book plus a scenarios book&#10;     Various player aid cards for charts and tables&#10;     Set up cards for each scenario&#10;&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.&#10;&#10;Despite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.&#10;&#10;Note that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?&#10;&#10;THE SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;&#10;     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.&#10;     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.&#10;     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?&#10;     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.&#10;     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game).

As the old saying goes, the taller the tower, the more influential the family.&#10;&#10;Players are master builders trying to profit from these vanity-driven families. You build these towers floor by floor, ready to take credit for making them look good. From Mayfair&rsquo;s description of the game: &ldquo;You must shrewdly accept the building orders of the patrician families to position yourself in the right place at the right time. Play your cards right, and your name will be famous among the rich and powerful!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Patrician comes with 149 wooden tower pieces, 55 building cards, 20 prestige tokens, and a double-sided playing board.&#10;&#10;The board represents a number of cities, each of which will have 2 towers when the games ends.  Players have a hand of 3 cards, each indicating one city.  Playing a card allows that player to add a tower piece to the city indicated by the card.  Each city will have a specific number of tower pieces.  When the specified number of pieces are played to the city, the city is complete.  The player with the most pieces in each of the two towers will score points when the city is completed. The player replaces the played card by taking the card from the city where he played a tower piece.  As long as the city in uncompleted, a new card is added to the city to replace the one taken by the player.&#10;&#10;In addition to indicating a city, cards have one of 4 secondary functions.  They can have one or two Portraits from an influential family.  They can add a second tower piece to the same city. they can allow the player to move the top piece from one tower in any other city where the player has at least one tower piece, to the top of the other tower in that same city. Finally, a card may allow the player to take a replacement card from any of the cities, not just the one where the player has added a tower piece.  All cards played are kept by the player.  At the end of the game, additional points are awarded for every complete set of 3 portraits from the influential families.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cities are completed, which will also be when all cards have been played.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the most successful builder, indicated by having the most points.&#10;&#10;",5,50,10,2,50,Patrician,50,2007,Design/Main,Strategy,Michael Schacht,,"Area Control / Area Influence,Hand Management,Set Collection","AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Mayfair Games",6.62669,1278,2-3

31554,"Red Dragon Rising: The Coming War With China (RDR), is a strategic-level investigation, with operational undertones, of the possibilities inherent in the first 30-or-so days of a hypothetical war between the Peoples Republic of China and a US-led counter-alliance. The time frame is the not-too-distant future, roughly between now and the end of 2014. On the Chinese side, the viewpoint of the player is that of Peking's top-rung national leadership. On the US side, the opposing player represents the top-rung military commander in the Western Pacific theater. The game is easily adaptable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;The system &ndash; given we're dealing with events that haven't happened and therefore can't be studied in detail after the fact &ndash; has been crafted to present the war as a unitary vision rather than a strictly sequenced process. The action can alternately telescope or expand, sometimes moving ahead in whip snake lunges, at other times decelerating to dream-like slow motion. The system is more quantum mechanics than Newtonian, more Escher than Rockwell. Its presents a time-space inter-flow that can only be grasped in totality by the human mind once play is over and the entire war can be looked back on and chronicled in a reconstructed linear fashion (much like day-to-day reality).&#10;&#10;Three initial assumptions are as follows. First, the Chinese are cast &ndash; not unreasonably, we think &ndash; as the aggressors. Put in terms as politically correct as possible: they're the &quot;revisionist power&quot; here, the nation wanting to overturn the present-day status quo in the Western Pacific: they're conducting a strategic  offensive. Second, the war inevitably starts over Taiwan, as that island is the unavoidably the first strategic block Peking must neutralize on the way to becoming East Asia's hegemon. Third, the war will not begin with a nuclear attack; though the danger of that kind of escalation may not be far off.&#10;&#10;Most ground units in the game represent brigades (&quot;brigade combat teams&quot; or &quot;BCT&quot; for the US). The exceptions are: 1) the Singaporean army is entirely represented by just one unit-counter; and 2) the Taiwanese and Philippine armies are represented by their corps components.&#10;&#10;Aircraft units are mostly represented by mixed-type combat wing formations, though only one aircraft type &ndash; the predominant one for each such wing &ndash; is shown on each counter. Long range bombers have their own mono-type units that can't combine operations with the other tactical air wings in the game.&#10;&#10;Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groupings of vessels (Surface Action Groups). Aircraft carriers and cruise missile attack submarines each represent just one such vessel of those types. Other submarines are represented in groups called &quot;Subrons.&quot; On the area map, each inch equals approximately 100 miles.&#10;&#10;",2,180,0,1,180,Red Dragon Rising: The Coming War With China,180,2008,"Nicolás Eskubi,Joe Youst","Modern Warfare,Wargame",Bruce Costello,"Country: China,Magazine: Strategy & Tactics","Area Movement,Dice Rolling","Decision Games (I),Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

These guest tokens are then replaced with Prince tokens that is their own color, or of the same civilization as the chosen Guest or in any District of the island indicated by the Guest or any combination of these. This is repeated three times until all Guest tokens have been removed from the board.

There can only be one Monument per District, and this space, once acquired, cannot be retaken. For taking control of a District the player gains Prestige Points during Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points. Also, if the District belongs to an island where a Wonder has been constructed, the owner of the Wonder immediately scores the number of Prestige Points indicated on the District.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Development of the City&#10;&#10;Each player receives 5 Action cards and discards based on their score in the score track.

Four types of actions are possible and occur multiple times in a player's turn:&#10;&#10;1) Move one or two princes:&#10;&#10;If a player decides to move two princes with a single action card, these two princes must be within the same District and make the same movement.&#10;&#10;LAND MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization to an adjacent District (Districts are separated by alleys or bridges).&#10;&#10;SEA MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization from one maritime District (showing a ship) to another maritime District. These two Districts must be in the same maritime sector or in two adjacent maritime sectors. (The division of the maritime sectors is indicated by the dotted lines originating from the 3 lighthouses of the city).&#10;&#10;2) Add a prince:&#10;&#10;By discarding an Action Card, a player may place a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization.&#10;&#10;3) Remove a Prince:&#10;&#10;If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. Th e player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.&#10;&#10;or 4) Influence the King (altering the Prestige Scale):&#10;&#10;If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. The player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.&#10;&#10;The value of each civilization, indicated on the Prestige Scale, determines the point value of the districts controlled by each player at the end of the turn. By discarding an Action Card, a player may increase the value of a civilization by 1. The Value figure of the civilization changes places with the figure directly above it. With two Action cards, a player may reduce the value of a civilization to 1. All the other figures are moved up accordingly.

With victory so close, and with Germany closer to world domination than they would ever be before or since &ndash; the Russian line held &ndash; it was A Victory Denied.&#10;&#10;Building on the enormous critical success of A Victory Lost, A Victory Denied is a wargame that offers the same elegant simplicity of A Victory Lost but also covers the unique aspects of this great battle.  While the system remains the same, upgraded supply rules and command structure rules will be added to model how important these problems were in this battle &ndash; and air power and Stalin&rsquo;s Organs will make their first appearance in the system.  But what made A Victory Lost so special will still be in full force &ndash; easy rules, unpredictable chit pulls, wild game play, and the ability to play the game almost right out of the box.&#10;&#10;International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 7 days&#10;Hex: 10 miles / 16 Km&#10;Units: Division &amp; Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page rules booklet&#10;Two Palyer Aid Cards (2-sided)&#10;Two dice (One 10-sided &amp; One 6-sided)&#10;&#10;Solitaire rating: Excellent&#10;Complexity: Low&#10;Playing time: 4 hours&#10;Scenarios: 1&#10;&#10;",2,360,0,2,360,A Victory Denied,360,2009,Nicolás Eskubi,"Wargame,World War II",Adam Starkweather,"Cities: Smolensk,Country: Russia,International Games Series,A Victory Lost Series","Chit-Pull System,Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Simulation","Game Journal,Multi-Man Publishing",7.4076,334,2-3

Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams.&#10;&#10;The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel.&#10;&#10;The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved.

33003,"The Caucasus Campaign: The Russo-German War - July - November, 1942&#10;&#10;In late July of 1942, Hitler sent two strong armies south across the Don to seize the fertile Kuban and the oil of the Caucasus. Germany's 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army steamrolled over all opposition until they reached the mountains. There the Russians slowed and then stopped the Germans at the outskirts of Novorossisk, on the road to Tuapse and along the Terek River. This infuriated Hitler who then took over personal command of Army Group A and poured replacements and reinforcements into the area that were badly needed at Stalingrad. Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don.&#10;&#10;The Axis forces include 2 mountain divisions, 2 light (j&auml;ger) divisions, an SS motorized division (Wiking), and 3 panzer divisions -- two of which had three tank battalions while many on the east front have only one. The German army is accompanied by 1 Slovakian and 7 Romanian divisions.&#10;&#10;The ranks of the Soviet army in the Caucasus is filled with Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Cossacks and Turkoman who have questionable loyalty. These divisions are reinforced by Soviet Guard and NKVD units sent across the Caspian, and by Soviet Naval troops stationed along the Black Sea.&#10;&#10;The Caucasus Campaign is a quick playing, moderately complex game with large hexes and easy-viewing 5/8 counters.

33030,"The complete game is published by Victory Point Games who, along with the designer, Jim Dunnigan, have allowed a version to be included in RBM's C3i Magazine Nr20. The designer has added new pieces and scenarios to this edition of the game.&#10;&#10;This 2-player game recreates General Patton's attempt to seize the key city of Metz and to get across the Moselle River before the retreating Germans can form an effective defense.  The U.S. forces comprised of three divisions of the 20th Corps had just completed an epic pursuit across France after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead.  The exhausted Allied forces were at the end of their supply line and has barely enough resources left for one last push. If they had been able to get across the Moselle River, they would have compromised the entire German Westwall defenses. This would have enabled Patton to make an attempt at crossing the Rhine before the end of 1944 and might have ended the war months earlier.  The defending German forces, four divisions of the 82nd Corps of the German 1st Army, were a combination of hastily collected and organized units, including fresh units from the German interior and remnants of units that Patton had been pursuing across France. The battle, which began on 7 September 1944 and lasted for about a week, was a singular opportunity that could have gone either way.

Three times the Germans drove them back, until finally on 18 May 1944 a troop of Polish Lancers raised their red-and-white pennant over the ruins.

34585,"Keltis is a multi-player game based on Lost Cities, with some rules changes, later published with Knizia's original rules and theme as Lost Cities: The Board Game.&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: &#10;&#10;     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). &#10;     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. &#10;     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&#10;&#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high. In LCBG, you must go low to high.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;There are more differences that are non-substantive.

35400,"White Star Rising introduces Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing&rsquo;s Nations at War (NAW) game system. Based on the popular World at War, NAW depicts platoon level combat in World War II. Here you&rsquo;ll find everything you're looking for in a platoon-level game -- armor, artillery, infantry that serves as more than cannon fodder, command and control, air support, amphibious landings, and desperate close assaults that leave the victor in possession of the ground and the defeated in headlong retreat, all in eight pages of rules. That&rsquo;s two less than the World at War system.&#10;&#10;Units represent platoons of vehicles, such as M-10 Wolverines, M4A3E8 Easy Eight Shermans, and German Panthers, Tigers, and Mark IVs. Of course White Star Rising isn&rsquo;t all about tanks. There&rsquo;s plenty of infantry; paratroopers, line doggies, Fallschirmjaeger, and Volksgrenadiers. In the same vein as the World at War system, the infantry are capable of moving fast and hitting hard. White Star Rising also includes support weapons, such as heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that infantry platoons can use to lethal effect.&#10;&#10;The system throws typical turn-based gaming out the window. The platoons are grouped into formations (usually battalions and kampfgruppen) and led by a headquarters. Each unit of the formation must be within range of the HQ to activate with its formation. Although individual units might activate, and recon units can double their range from the HQ, you&rsquo;ll want to keep those formations together. The formations are activated by chit draw, and better-trained, better-led units can activate more than once in a turn, moving, shooting, and fighting in each activation. On the flip side, there is no guarantee that a formation will activate even once. The cup into which the formation chits are placed is seeded with end turn chits. When the second end turn chit is drawn the turn ends. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if a single formations has activated; the turn is over. It keeps you on your toes.&#10;&#10;When attacking, each platoon rolls a number of dice equal to its firepower. Every die that equals or exceeds the &ldquo;to hit&rdquo; number (right superscript) hits the target. The target then rolls a number of dice equal to its armor factor plus terrain advantages. Each die that equals or exceeds its armor factor negates a hit. The first hit disrupts a unit, second reduces it, the third eliminates it.&#10;&#10;Units may also close assault, entering the opponent&rsquo;s hex to either deal a death blow or force him (or her) out of valuable terrain. Same procedure, but both units use their close assault value. The side that takes the most hits must retreat from the hex. Infantry is VERY good at this, especially against armor without its own infantry support.&#10;&#10;Game includes rules for thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons (actual counters that represent heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that add to an infantry platoon&rsquo;s capabilities), air support, bunkers, wire, artillery, mines, overruns opportunity fire, line-of-sight rules that have been streamlined since their inception in World at War, transporting infantry--and all in eight pages of rules.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;    2 sheets (approximate 200 total) .75&quot; counters&#10;    4 professionally-drawn, printed, 11&quot; x 17&quot;  geomorphic maps&#10;    18 scenarios&#10;    2 players' aid cards&#10;    4 dice &#10;    20 page full color rule, scenario, and chart book.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Other Games in Series:&#10;&#10;    Nations at War: White Star Rising&#10;    Nations at War: Desert Heat&#10;    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph&#10;    White Star Rising: Airborne&#10;    White Star Rising: Operation Cobra&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    World at War: Eisenbach Gap&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,120,12,2,60,Nations at War: White Star Rising,120,2010,Marc von Martial,"Wargame,World War II","Sean Druelinger,Mark H.

35476,"GMT is proud to present Vance von Borries&rsquo; sixth epic game in his award winning series of East Front games, Barbarossa: Crimea. This is a two-player operational level game depicting the battles in the Crimean peninsula of the Soviet Union during 1941 and 1942. Beginning in mid-October 1941 and ending in January 1942, it completes the year 1941 in this series of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. And it includes 1942 scenarios of the continued fighting in Crimea until the historical fall of the great Soviet naval fortress Sevastopol in July 1942.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;One 22x34 inch map&#10;840 counters&#10;Rule booklet in color&#10;Playbook in color&#10;Various player aid cards for charts and tables in color&#10;Set up cards for each scenario in color&#10;4 Scenario cards 11x17&#10;1 ten sided die&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, waffen SS, NKVD, militia, base units, naval units, and more. You have reinforcement options to tailor your army to fight a full campaign with many historical variables.&#10;&#10;As we have indicated with each game, all games in this series share the same game mechanics. Veteran East Front Series (EFS) players will find much here that is familiar. Such mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away, and for them we have clarified many game procedures. For those who are new to the series, examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.&#10;&#10;All games of the EFS series are built to fit together side-by-side for possible combined play. We recognize that space is at a premium for some of you, so consider that all of the eight scenarios in this game require only one map or less; yes, just one map! Newcomers should try this game as a sample of the whole series.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Crimea includes several special features not found with all EFS games. Since the game revolves around Sevastopol, we include a special inset map to depict in detail the fighting at that important naval fortress. Much gaming will directly involve the inset, so we have streamlined previous series rules dealing with an inset map. We have also streamlined the naval rules, effectively rebuilding them. This in turn allowed us to rebuild the Odessa scenario found with the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series. There, and later in Crimea, the Soviets used amphibious operations to move battle lines forward. If an amphibious operation is not going well, the Soviets could declare an Evacuation. At Sevastopol the German player will be using his super-heavy artillery, including the world&rsquo;s largest artillery piece, Dora, historically seen in the final game scenario. The design notes include an essay on these wonder-weapons.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Crimea challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?&#10;&#10;THE SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;1) Learning Scenario: The Tartar Ditch. The German 11th Army has just received orders to enter the Crimea but to do so it must first clear the narrow Perekop Isthmus. This was the first battle for the Crimea. This is a small scenario but it teaches important lessons in precise game unit positioning - exactly what one would expect for historical positional warfare.&#10;&#10;2) Odessa: Hero City. This is a bloody example of siege warfare. The Romanian army shows exactly why it was so ill-suited for such an offensive, while the Soviets struggle to balance their forces from sector-to-sector and endure delays of reinforcements coming by sea. This rebuilds the scenario found in theArmy Group South game using new research and this game&rsquo;s improved naval rules.&#10;&#10;3) Crimea: The Road to Sevastopol. This begins in mid October 1941. The Germans almost certainly will break through the main Soviet defense line, so the Soviet player has to know when to break away from the action and run back to fresh prepared positions, a tactic typical of game play in other series games. The German player also chooses secret victory conditions. He will either drive south to Sevastopol or southeast to Kerch, forcing the Soviet to balance his defense of both.&#10;&#10;4) Sevastopol: The First Battle. With the Germans committed to Sevastopol, can the Soviet divert enough German attention elsewhere to save the fortress? In the meantime, the deeper the German pushes into the Sevastopol inset map, the better his chances for long-term victory.&#10;&#10;5) Crimean Campaign. The campaign scenario puts scenarios 3 and 4 together to feature a punch and counter-punch game strategy. The Soviet player relies on his naval units to rapidly shift the threat. The German relies on his infantry to consolidate gains.&#10;&#10;6) Kerch: The Party Boss Attack. Ever wonder why Mandated Attacks exist in this game system? In the middle of winter 1942 one of Stalin&rsquo;s cronies thought the armies holding the Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea were not sufficiently motivated to defeat the fascists. He personally bullied the local Front commander into do-or-die attacks. This scenario exemplifies the insanity of political expectations trumping battlefield realities. Can you find a weakness in the Axis line?&#10;&#10;7) Kerch: Operation Trappenjagd. Now it is the German turn to attack in the Kerch Peninsula but their champion knows how to attack. This is a brilliantly planned German attack, one that pays handsome dividends. Can you repeat Manstein&rsquo;s success? As the Soviet can you defeat Manstein&rsquo;s attack?&#10;&#10;8) Sevastopol: Operation Storfang. This is the last picture show in the Crimea and it will be bloody. Truly, the best is saved for the last as the Soviets fight for every last hill, fort, and farmhouse. They went down fighting and their sacrifice earned them great honor in the history books. It was close. The German plan of offensive was sound and it met each challenge the Soviets posed. Can you duplicate Manstein&rsquo;s cold calculations and earn your marshal&rsquo;s baton?&#10;&#10;",2,240,0,2,240,Barbarossa: Crimea,240,2010,"Rodger B.

35477,"Dead of Winter is GMT&rsquo;s recreation of Richard Berg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Battles of the American Civil War series&rdquo; series title on the battle of Murfreesboro; also known as The Battle of Stone&rsquo;s River to Union Veterans. Perhaps one of the most evenly matched battles of the war, Murfreesboro/Stone&rsquo;s River pitted the Federal Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Starke Rosecrans against the Confederate Army of Tennessee captained by General Braxton Bragg. With near parity of numbers (each side fielded roughly 40,000 men) and remarkably similar battle plans, both armies grappled in the December cold for control of Middle Tennessee.&#10;&#10;The Series:&#10;&#10;The GBACW Series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental Level Gettysburg game - Terrible Swift Sword - created by Richard Berg in 1976. Since then, the series has undergone numerous system evolutions, always seeking to enhance the player&rsquo;s illusion of reality. Today, the series relies on inter-active chit-pull mechanics to simulate the sometimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield. GMT's Red Badge Of Courage and Gringo! Are the two most recent releases in this classic line of games.&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;Dead of Winter II completely revisits this battle. The old version needed a face-lift. The biggest change is in returning the ground scale to 110 yards per hex.  While going to the larger scale means an increase in maps, the added elbow room allows for much more historical unit frontages and more playable stacking.&#10; One Introductory and ten regular scenarios examine every aspect of the historical battle and present the players with several plausible alternative situations based on events leading up to the actual engagement. Scenario sizes range from one-half of one map and an hour to play, to all four maps and many enjoyable gaming hours. Also included are a number of optional forces that could have plausibly been brought into the fight; Keep your opponent guessing as to what he will face next with this interesting range of options.&#10;&#10;The Team: &#10;While Richard Berg remains the final authority for all things GBACW, and John Alsen continues his invaluable role in the development of each title, Dead of Winter II adds one more well-known gaming name to the mix: Designer Dave Powell. Dave has designed more than a dozen civil war simulation games with The Gamers, Inc, (now owned by MMP.) Dave has always loved the GBACW since the moment he first opened the box for TSS, and welcomed the chance to bring his design talents and historical skills to the Dead of Winter project.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Design: Dave Powell&#10;Series Design: Richard H.

This game covers the defense of the little crossroads town of Bastogne from 18 December to 26 December 1944. It is not a game about the whole Ardennes Offensive, but rather a close-up look at the actual perimeter battle to protect the town and the mechanized delaying actions leading into it. The map only extends as far east as Longvilly and north to Noville at 400m per hex.

Powerful guilds within the empire are squabbling, positioning themselves for their own gain. If the Empire is to survive, it needs a strong leader - that means you! You must build a power base throughout the Empire by connecting with important guilds: the military, traders, priests, engineers, expansionists, and politicians and then claim the throne. Time is running out, though; others also struggle for the throne. You must form a network of support with powerful guilds and slander your opponents. Each connection gains the support of some guilds, and at the end of the game the player with the most support grasps the Galactic Throne. Take advantage of events that occur for further gain.

Napoleon's France enjoys a superb army, central position, superior leadership, and a useful, if not powerful, ally in Spain. However, she faces three foes.&#10;&#10;Napoleon must beware of Britain's seapower and wealth, Austria's threatening position, and Russia's reinforcing hordes. In the wings, Prussia, Turkey, and Sweden teeter on the brink of war, begging inducements to join either side.

The deck is shuffled, then set up with three or four &quot;Feeding time!&quot; cards shuffled into the deck at various points. On a turn, a player first turns up a card from the deck if the market is empty (as it is as the start of the game). Then the player looks at the fish and plant cards in the market and decides whether to pass or try to buy them. If he passes, he takes $2 from the bank and adds the top card to the market; if he wants to buy, all other players get to influence what's on the market and what the cards cost.&#10;&#10;First, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 1 of a buy. These cards force the active player to add, remove or swap a card from the market or simply allow the card player to make a fish swap of his own! (Players can also pass, with all action cards but the &quot;pass&quot; being set aside.) Second, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 2 of a buy. These cards add or subtract 1 from the cost of the market, or double or halve the cost of the market. In the latter case, the player of the card receives money from the active player instead of those coins going to the bank.&#10;&#10;Once the goods and the cost are set, the active player chooses to buy all the fish and plants on offer or none of them. The cost is equal to the sum of the card values, plus or minus any modifications, then doubled or halved as appropriate. All purchased cards go into a player's personal aquarium. If a player has two identical fish, he can move them to a separate breeding tank where they will earn him 1-3 coins each turn.&#10;&#10;Each time a &quot;Feeding time!&quot; card is revealed, players reveal one &quot;food cost&quot; card at random, then pay money equal to that cost times the number of stars on fish and plants in their aquariums.

36887,"Description courtesy of BoardgameNews.com&#10;&#10;Waterloo &ndash; a two-player game for early 2009 with the French and British fighting once again. The action system is a clever creation: You know the range of possible actions that you can take on a turn, but the opponent knows exactly how many actions you have, and that knowledge strips the certainty from your preparation. Can you get your infantry back in a defensive position before the opponent thunders through with his cavalry? If you don&rsquo;t think you can, you might develop timidly, which gives the opponent a better shot of taking valuable terrain.&#10;&#10;Damage in the game is represented by blue/red/black cubes, and you can distribute the cubes throughout your lines during the game to represent the movement of troops back and forth from the front lines. Shifting all the damage to the back seems like a no-brainer, but if cavalry does break through your front line, your troops are toast. Morale is checked only in face-to-face combat, and it&rsquo;s handled by a die roll compared with the level of damage within an area.&#10;&#10;Control of areas like La Haye Sainte is critical. Just as Wellington tried to funnel French attacks through gaps in ridges in order to cut off their support, you can do the same, fighting for highland to prevent being pinched.

Plus many types of troops and support weapons, from motorcycle troops and horsed cavalry through the awesome 155mm GPF rifle.&#10;&#10;The Germans receive their full set of panzers, from the puny PzKw I through the PzKw IIIE and 38t. There are vehicles not seen before in the Panzer Grenadier series like the SiG33 assault gun, and a set of pieces for Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in their own colors.&#10;&#10;There are eight semi-rigid mapboards, the same type as those found in Eastern Front, created by Guy Riessen, who crafted the widely-praised maps for Elsenborn Ridge.&#10;&#10;",2,120,0,2,120,Panzer Grenadier: 1940 – The Fall of France,120,2009,Guy Riessen,"Wargame,World War II","Michael Bennighof,Philippe Leonard",Panzer Grenadier,"Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Modular Board,Secret Unit Deployment,Simulation",Avalanche Press Ltd.,7.67778,72,2-3

Bombers unleash a downpour of destruction on the Finnish capital of Helsinki. In the David and Goliath struggle that follows, the Russians &#10;swarm across the border and push back the Finns in victory after victory. The future appears grim for Finnish independence.&#10;&#10;Nowhere is the danger greater than in the central sector, where a Russian breakthrough would threaten the strongpoints of the Mannerheim Line. Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj&auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack...&#10;&#10;Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj&auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes many tried-and-true &quot;classic&quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.

38830,"This new version of Destruction of Army Group Center is a thorough redesign, by Ty Bomba, of the game originally published by old-SPI in the early 1970s (in S&amp;T#36). The campaign under examination is &ldquo;Operation Bagration,&rdquo; the Red Army&rsquo;s summer offensive of 1944 during which they destroyed more German manpower and equipment than had been lost at Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;Without question a one-sided affair in terms of which side is &lsquo;shaping the battlefield&rsquo; and &lsquo;controlling the tempo,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve managed to make things more interesting for both players by broadening the map to cover not only Byelorussia, but all of the Baltic Republics as well as the northwest Ukraine. That expansion gives both players more interesting options and strategies in terms of how to pursue victory.&#10; Each hex on the 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map equals 16 miles (26 kilometers). Each of the nine game turns equals one week, from IV June through IV August. Units of maneuver are corps (and static &ldquo;fortified localities&rdquo;) for the Germans and armies for the Soviets. The latter&rsquo;s great airpower advantage is represented in the form of 10 &ldquo;air armies.&rdquo; There are 176 large-size unit-counters included, most done in NATO-style, but also with iconic markers. The system is an adaptation of the one used in issue number three&rsquo;s Bulge, which means two experienced players can finish a match in about three to four hours.&#10;&#10;The historical scenario provides exact set ups for both sides, but there are also free-deployment options. The &ldquo;Bold Stroke&rdquo; scenario allows the Soviet player to try the approach the Germans were expecting: putting the weight of the offensive in the western Pripyat Marsh and driving straight for Koenigsberg. Other options allow the investigation of such historical &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; as the failure of the Western Allies&rsquo; D-Day landing or no July bomb plot against Hitler.&#10;&#10;",2,180,0,2,180,Destruction of Army Group Center (second edition),180,2009,,"Wargame,World War II",Ty Bomba,Magazine: World at War,"Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Simulation",Decision Games (I),6.742,50,2-3
38837,"The Pocket at Falaise is a game on the final phase of the Allied campaign in Normandy. After the failure of Hitler&rsquo;s counterattack in early August to halt the Allied breakout from Normandy, the German 7th and 5th Panzer Armies found themselves on the verge of being pocketed by converging American and British pincers. On the evening of August 16th the Germans began to pull back behind the Orne and Dives rivers, hoping to regroup for a defense of the Seine, even as the Allies attempted to close the trap on some twentyfive German divisions. Ultimately, about half the German forces in the pocket escaped, leaving almost all their heavy equipment behind. It was a major Allied victory, but not a war-winning one.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Gulf War in '91, cable TV news was full of horrific photos from the &quot;Highway of Death,&quot; the route back to Iraq from Kuwait that seemed, almost literally, to be &quot;paved&quot; with burnt-out vehicles. Those who study WWII remember similar destruction... on the road out of the Falaise Pocket... where 25 German divisions raced for survival, while the Allied armies aimed to turn Hitler's delayed counterattack on Normandy from failure to war-ending disaster. In one sense, neither side succeeded. But the devastation was something unprecedented.&#10;&#10;Now, you have a chance to do better. The Pocket at Falaise puts each player in the difficult position of trying to overcome the obstacles, both human and mechanical, tactical and operational, that interfered with success in 1944. Award-winning designer Ted Racier explains:&#10;&#10;The story of the Falaise battle is that of two German armies trying to escape a trap set for them by their own high command, and of the Allied armies trying to close the trap, despite the hesitations and divisions of their own higher commanders.&#10;&#10;While we may think of the Allies as having overwhelming forces, at the actual point of contact, there were relatively weak units trying to &quot;plug the leak&quot; against overwhelming numbers of intensely motivated Germans. The situation means that the &quot;retreating&quot; Germans are actually forced to do a lot of attacking, while the &quot;advancing&quot; allies found themselves in a desperate defense. The Pocket at Falaise uses a chit-pull activation system to capture some of the chaotic and uncoordinated efforts. Players are forced to juggle to make the best out of an increasingly difficult situation, and a combat scale that straddles &quot;tactical&quot; and &quot;operational,&quot; aiming to capture the best of both without adding a lot of fiddly rules. A complete set of solitaire rules for the game completes the package.&#10;&#10;Eisenhower called it, &quot;The Great Killing Ground.&quot; What the Germans called it cannot be printed.

With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian&rsquo;s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought.&#10;&#10;Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; 8 page color Rules booklet&#10;&bull; 4 page Reference booklet&#10;&bull; 4 page Scenarios booklet&#10;&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color map&#10;&bull; Three Player Aid Sheets&#10;&bull; 40 color, die-cut two-sided 5/8&rdquo; mounted game pieces&#10;&bull; 11 round game markers&#10;&bull; 24 Event cards&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is 1 army or front, each hex is 100 kilometers, and each turn is 2 months.&#10;&#10;",2,45,0,1,45,No Retreat!,45,2008,Alan Emrich,"Wargame,World War II",Carl Paradis,"No Retreat series,Solitaire Games,Solitaire Wargames","Campaign / Battle Card Driven,Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter","Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

As the game begins, the defense of Vitebsk, a Byelorussian fortified city located just a few hexes beyond the southeast corner of the playing surface, has just collapsed. 1st Baltic Front is advancing westward through the shredded German line, and will soon threaten all of Army Group North with encirclement. Finally, after four months of fierce battle, the Red Army will win the great prize of this campaign, Riga, and pocket the enemy in the Courland region of Latvia.&#10;&#10;Baltic Gap allows players to explore this interesting campaign from a variety of historical and hypothetical vantage points. Long campaign games can be enjoyed by up to five players.

In this game, a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. A card shows a combination of two different colors/symbols familiar to those who know the Ingenious board game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.&#10;&#10;As in Ingenious, players take an extra turn immediately if they max out the points available in a color, with ten being the highest number in Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel.&#10;&#10;Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.&#10;&#10;",4,30,8,2,20,Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel,30,2008,Michaela Kienle,Card,Reiner Knizia,Ingenious,"Hand Management,Pattern Building","Bard Centrum Gier,KOSMOS",5.85945,238,2-3

40243,"Campaign Commander Volume I: Roads to Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;&quot;Roads to Stalingrad&quot; is the first volume of the Campaign Commander Series and depicts the campaign in southern Russia from the summer of 1942 to the end of the winter of 1943. After a terrible first winter in Russia, the German troops reorganized and readied themselves to launch the offensive to end the war. The soviets got ready first; they launched an attack to retake Kharkov that ended in disaster for the troops involved. After finishing this offensive the Axis forces - numbering many Hungarians, Romanians and Italians - launched, at the beginning of July 1942 the operation code named &quot;Case Blue&quot;. German advance seemed unstoppable, reaching the Caucasus and the banks of the river Volga. At the city of Stalingrad the German army would experience a real nightmare fighting through August to October in an attempt to conquer it. Control of the city meant that the Germans could cut the traffic along the Volga, while for the Soviets it became a symbol of resistance against the invaders. Both Stalin and Hitler sent more and more troops to the cauldron of that destroyed city, into the fiercest and bloodiest battle ever known in history. In the event, conquering the city was rather useless to the Germans since, beginning on the 19th of November, Operation Uranus was launched and Marshall Zhukov could trap the German 6th Army into the ruins just won. Successive soviet offensives destroyed the Italian, Romanian and Hungarian armies on the river Don, forcing the Germans to evacuate their conquests in the Caucasus and endangering even the survival of the whole German Army Group South. Only the timely intervention of Marshall Erich von Manstein allowed the Germans to stop the Soviet advance and stabilize the front, thus saving an already catastrophic situation.&#10;&#10;The game is played at the operational level - with a zonal map at a 1:120000 scale. Designed for two players, one handles the Axis while the other commands the Soviets. The game has an estimated playing time of 3-4 hours and uses a double system of counters/map and cards in its mechanics. Players must use appropriately their troops and resources to obtain victory points either by destroying enemy forces or by occupying cities on the map. This is not a card driven game, cards are used for causing certain events, influence the outcome of battles and to place on map the necessary resources and reinforcements to fight on.&#10;&#10;The game starts in summer, the Axis player has the initiative and will mercilessly and relentlessly pound the Soviets. The Soviet player will have to hope for the winter - a card to be played given certain conditions - to stop the Axis advance and defeat them.&#10;&#10;As the other titles in the series, this game has very simple rules and has been designed to make games wholly interactive, creating a solid and enjoyable experience for those who simply cannot find the time and space to play a longer and more complex game.&#10;&#10;The Axis player must face the historical disjunctive, should he concentrate on taking the Caucasus, Stalingrad or both? The Soviet player will have to be patient and force his enemy to overextend his resources, at the same time managing to accumulate forces for a lethal winter offensive.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;- 1 80 x 65 cm map of southern Russia, Ukraine and the Caucasus. &#10;- 2 d10 dice &#10;- 176 counters 5/8 counters (1 sheet)&#10;- 1 Campaign Commander Series Rules and Roads to Stalingrad Exclusive Rules and historical and design notes. &#10;- 70 cards (divided in two decks + aids + promotional)&#10;&#10;The game will be published in Spanish version also.&#10;&#10;&#10;El juego se publicar&aacute; en versi&oacute;n espa&ntilde;ola para los clientes de habla hispana.&#10;&#10;",2,180,0,2,180,Campaign Commander Volume I: Roads to Stalingrad,180,2009,"José Ramón Faura,Carmen J.

41033,"September 1st, 1939: Germany invades Poland, setting off the Second World War. Except for minor attacks, France and Great Britain, the victors of World War One, do nothing. The Allies view the short Polish campaign of 1939 as a case of a newer, larger army winning out over an older, smaller army. Certainly the massed panzers are impressive, and need to be emulated, but the winter months see little positive activity on the Allied side. Missing the more vital lessons of the Polish campaign, the Allies are content to wait. Not only do their armies outnumber the Germans in terms of manpower, tanks and artillery, they have the advantage of operating on the defensive. Meanwhile the Germans feverishly apply the lessons they learned in Poland, and hone their operational techniques. The surprise German conquest of Norway jolts the Allies out of their lethargy. They do not have long to wait for the next blow.&#10;&#10;May 10th, 1940: Germany unleashes its Blitzkrieg upon the western Allies. Six weeks later, the war ends in a smashing German victory. Four Allied national armies have vanished. The tiny Dutch and Belgian armies, pulverized in battle, have surrendered. Great Britain rescues most of the soldiers in the BEF, but their heavy weapons and vehicles remain on the beaches of Dunkirk. The island nation begins to re-arm, but for now is out of the fight. The proud French Army, with many regiments tracing an unbroken lineage back to the 1600s, suffers the most catastrophic defeat of modern times before France surrenders.&#10;&#10;How did this happen? The Germans, realizing they could not win a repeat of World War One, set about reinventing the offense. Their formula included massed tank formations, an air force dedicated to close tactical support, and most importantly, a command and control system based on the use of radios. Allied tanks and soldiers were often equal or superior to their German counterparts &ndash; when given the opportunity to properly deploy and prepare. Unfortunately, such opportunities were few and far between. The Germans had securely positioned themselves inside an Allied decision making process that often took days to execute, rapidly concentrating, overwhelming defenders and then exploiting success. Certainly there were answers to every German innovation, but in six short weeks the Allies did not have the time to find them.&#10;&#10;Case Yellow is a simple, but accurate, simulation recreating this monumental campaign. Each game turn is divided into eight action segments. Each player has four action chits. The initiative player selects the first action chit to play. The remaining seven chits are placed in an opaque cup and drawn randomly. In most cases the Germans have the initiative and go first by playing one of their four action chits. Each German chit is marked for movement or combat, and the German player chooses what his army will do (though the German player during the course of a turn must use two chits for movement and two chits for combat). At the end of movement, any panzer or motorized formation adjacent to Allied units has the option to attack. If combat is chosen, all German units adjacent to Allied units may attack if allowed by terrain.&#10;&#10;Two Allied chits are marked two for movement and two for combat &ndash; not both.  The creaky Allied command structure will bedevil the Allied player throughout the game. Need to move? Sorry &ndash; you just drew a combat chit. Set up to attack? You drew a move chit, and only the number of motorized formations equaling the roll of a six-sided die can attack.&#10;&#10;Zones of control reflect that the infantry of both sides still fight by the rules of World War One. Infantry units must stop when entering an enemy zone of control. Mount a one hex infantry attack against a defender hex, and you attack only the units in the defender hex. Mount a two hex (or greater) infantry attack against a defender hex, and all adjacent enemy hexes must also be attacked (large-scale infantry attacks take time to set up, and the defender has the time to integrate adjacent units into the defense plan).&#10;&#10;Motorized units play by different rules, though the Germans with their better-trained, veteran formations do it much better than the Allies. Simply stated, any motorized unit with a Troop Quality (TQ) higher than any adjacent unit may disregard those adjacent units&rsquo; zones of control for purposes of movement, combat and retreat. Only a solid line is proof against motorized unit exploitation and envelopment, and only so long as combat does not create gaps. Additionally, motorized units only may attack a defender hex from two hexes without engaging any other adjacent defender units &ndash; the speed of motorized concentration allows the attack to go in before a traditional defensive response can be established.&#10;&#10;The Luftwaffe is present in overwhelming strength, allowing the German player to negate the toughest defensive positions if necessary. Each Luftwaffe asset marker provides a one column shift on the combat table. Each Allied air asset marker provides the same shift, but there are far fewer Allied markers &ndash; not that the Allies had far fewer planes (they had almost as many), but the Allied air-ground coordination was so cumbersome that planes usually did not arrive in time to influence the battles being fought.&#10;&#10;",2,180,0,1,180,"Case Yellow, 1940: The German Blitzkrieg in the West",180,2011,"Rodger B.

41429,"Band of Brothers is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII.  It covers the exploits of the 101st in their battles from D-Day through the Bulge. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.&#10;&#10;Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic.  There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression.  This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something.  You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops.  Their goal is to fire and maneuver.  Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close.  The system itself forces this realistic play.  In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;The game is the first in a series.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers:  Ghost Panzer is a stand alone game that is set on the Eastern Front and follows the German 11th Panzer (Ghost) Division&#10;&#10;Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.&#10;&#10;",2,90,12,2,90,Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles,90,2011,"Michael Evans (II),Christopher Ono,Brandon Pennington,Dan Safee","Wargame,World War II",Jim Krohn,"Band of Brothers,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter","Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Modular Board","Worthington Games,Worthington Publishing, LLC",7.89142,403,2-3

As Russia&rsquo;s communist government was burning secret papers and evacuating Lenin&rsquo;s corpse eastward out of their ancient capital, Moscow was hanging in the balance.

51195,"Adaptoid is a board game for two players designed by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s in 2007. Each game lasts around 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;An adaptoid is a creature that constantly evolves to adapt itself to its surroundings. To survive it needs to be fed. In adaptoid, two armies of adaptoids must confront one another with the aim of eliminating all opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 37-space hexagonal board. Each player receives a supply of adaptoid bodies in either white or black which are plastic discs with laser-cut sockets ready to receive one of the small pile of claws and legs in the colour of each player. The capabilities of each of the adaptoids varies through the game depending on how many and what type of appendage are added.&#10;&#10;Each player turn has 3 phases: Movement, Growth and Feeding. In the movement phase, the player may move one of their adaptoids as many spaces as it has limbs. Adaptoids cannot move through occupied spaces, but they can move on top of an opposing adaptoid to initiate a capture.&#10;&#10;In the growth phase the player must either spawn a new, empty, adaptoid next to one of their existing pieces or add a leg or a claw to any adaptoid already on the board.&#10;&#10;In the feeding phase, every enemy piece is checked for starvation. An adaptoid requires space to graze equal to its number of limbs. Any enemy piece which has fewer empty spaces around it than limbs starves to death and is removed. Starving your opponent to death (or indeed having them incautiously starve themselves) is worth a point.&#10;&#10;The resolution of capture move is simple. The adaptoid with the most claws wins and the other adaptoid is removed from the board. If both pieces have the same number of claws, both are removed with a point going to each player. Starved or captured pieces are returned to the supply ready for further use.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has either obtained 5 points by capturing and starving enemy adaptoids or has been completely eliminated from the board.&#10;&#10;",2,20,8,2,20,Adaptoid,20,2009,Néstor Romeral Andrés,Strategy,Néstor Romeral Andrés,Combinatorial,"Area Enclosure,Grid Movement",nestorgames,6.99487,117,2-3

The treasure was found, not lying about, but in dangerous caves guarded by fierce dragons.  Those strong enough to gather the dragon&rsquo;s treasures had to compete among themselves for privileges that would smooth the way to the Caliph&rsquo;s palace.  On reaching the palace, the heroes found their way blocked by powerful guards.  Here they could pass the guards only with the right influence or, failing that, generous bribes.  Within the palace walls, the heroes bartered their hard won treasures for magical artifacts in a contest to see who could acquire the most artifacts and gain the praise of the Caliph.&#10;&#10;The Aladdin&rsquo;s Dragons Card Game (Morgenland Kartenspiel) is based on the award winning board game of the same name published by Rio Grande and Hans im Gl&uuml;ck.

55131,"Murus Gallicus is a two-player breakthrough game in which players try to create impenetrable walls of stone reminiscent of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s Gallic Wars.&#10;&#10;The object of the Murus Gallicus is to reach your opponent's home row or to stalemate your opponent.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a rectangular board consisting of an 8x7 array of cells. Each player starts with a set of 16 tokens referred to as stones; one light set and one dark set. The board is placed between players so that there are seven rows and eight columns. To start the game, each player takes a set of stones and stacks two stones on each of their eight home cells; their nearest row. The Roman player uses the light set and goes first. The Gaul player uses the dark set. Players alternate turns.&#10;&#10;The basic units of the game are towers and walls. A tower consists of two like-colored stones in a cell. A wall is a single stone in a cell. Only towers move. The main function of walls is to block the opponent's movement and secondarily they act as stepping stones which can be used later on to create new towers. Towers move by sowing as in Mancala with a stacking limit of two and only like-colored stones may be stacked. Each of the destination cells must be empty or contain a friendly wall. Tower stones can be used to remove adjacent opponent walls. This is done by sacrifice! Material remains equal throughout the game but slowly erodes for both players as players defuse threats. A player is stalemated if unable to move/sow or sacrifice at the start of his or her turn. Going flat out (stalemating yourself) in order to stalemate your opponent can be very satisfying.&#10;&#10;Murus Gallicus is a game of balance, space and timing. Players must balance defense and offense. By controlling the board's center, a player can gain mobility. Players must wait for the right moment to squeeze through the opponent's defense. The endgame can be very tense thanks to the balance in material.&#10;&#10;There are several useful structures players can employ. The Gallic Wall consisting of orthogonally connected walls (and sometimes towers) requires the opponent to go around the wall or blast his or her way thorough using a sacrificed stone. The Chariot consists of a tower, wall and empty space aligned. By sowing the towers stones in the direction of the wall, the two-celled formation glides forward. The battering ram consists of two towers and an opponent wall aligned. By sacrificing a tower stone, the opponent's wall can be removed. The remaining chariot formation can then move through the breach on the player's next turn. Lastly, a siege tower is a tower sitting within striking distance of the opponent's home row. Such a tower can tie up many of your opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;The true excitement of the game is in the playing. A sneak attack that squeezes through a breach or a well-timed all out assault can be quite satisfying.&#10;&#10;",2,20,10,2,20,Murus Gallicus,20,2009,Néstor Romeral Andrés,Strategy,Phil Leduc,Combinatorial,Grid Movement,"(Web published),nestorgames",7.6549,51,2-3

TCS 4.0 rules.&#10;&#10;The battle depicted here begins on D-Day +2, June 8th, and continues for the next 3 days and was known by the Germans as the First Battle for Caen.

Aware of the resounding defeat that the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered the previous day at the hands of the Hitler Youth, the 7th prepares a Fortress around Bretteville, Norrey and Putot. The soldiers of The Regina Rifles and The Royal Winnipeg Rifles, still under-strength from their D-Day losses, wait their turn for the inevitable encounter with the Grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division.

63196,"Theme&#10;The theme of this game is similar to the original Three Dragon Ante. You are sitting in a bar in a fantasy world, playing cards for gold. The setting is a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons style bar and the game may be played as a sub-plot of a D&amp;D game if desired.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal is to have the most gold at the point where the first player runs out of gold. In a two player game, you just have to bankrupt your opponent, but in a larger game, you may have to prop up another player until you become the richest.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;A game is played over a series of hands until the end-condition is reached (above). A hand typically consists of playing one of your cards into the centre as an 'Ante' card, then three rounds of card-playing, attempting to play the best set (or 'Flight') of cards. The highest value Ante card determines the amount of gold that every player must contribute to the pot this round. The player who played the highest value Ante card starts the first round. Subsequent rounds are started by the player who played the highest value card in the previous round. Each card has both a numerical value and a power (or ability). However, the power is only triggered if the card has a lower or equal value to the card just played.&#10;&#10;The game is a balance between playing high cards to win the pot of gold in the Ante and playing lower cards to trigger their abilities and improve your hand for a later round.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by itself, or in combination with the original Three-Dragon Ante card set.&#10;&#10;From WoTC site:&#10;This fun card game updates the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game, adding new cards and new ways to foil your opponents!

The player who goes out scores zero points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their cards.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing cards on multiple rows, however, players play onto a single discard stack, with the played card being higher than the top card of the stack but not more than ten higher; if you can&rsquo;t play a card within this ten point range, you have to pick up the discard pile. Ergo, &quot;11 takes&quot;. You then start two new stacks by revealing cards from the top of the deck. The number of piles keeps growing throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Each time you take a stack with more than three cards, you get a bull card.

65825,"Martin Wallace's 2-player wargame for Treefrog's second line of games (2009-2010 series, 4th game of the series) dealing with the American Civil War - the players commanding either Confederate or Union forces. With Gettysburg Wallace wanted to produce a balanced rather than a historically accurate game. The game e.g. ignores casualty levels, and Units do not correspond exactly to brigades or divisions - even if the forces' proportion is close to historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;The player pieces in Gettysburg are similar to those in Treefrog's previous wargame, Waterloo. Each day consists of four periods, and the game is played over three days, and key locations must be held by the end of one period.  Each player has eight numbered 'order blocks', ranking from two to five.  Players then place such blocks in the game areas, the order block allowing a number of orders to be issued that area.  The orders can activate units in the same or adjacent areas.  Orders are represented by discs, once the number of order discs in an area matches the value of the order block then no more orders can be issued.  The players will then have to remove the block and place a new one. If a player does not have enough order discs for the following period, he will be forced to pass for each disc he is short.  Assault combat is similar to Waterloo, the main exceptions are that the attacker and defender use different morale check tables. The defender is more likely to retreat than be eliminated, but there is also the chance of a counter-attack to throw back the assaulting forces. The Confederate player wins by taking two starred areas, or Little Round Top.&#10;&#10;",2,180,13,2,180,Gettysburg,180,2010,Peter Dennis,"American Civil War,Wargame",Martin Wallace,Treefrog Line,"Action Point Allowance System,Dice Rolling","Treefrog Games,Warfrog Games",7.27538,266,2-3

It should be easy for Prince Charming to defeat a young boy, except that Hansel has an equally sinister sister, Gretel, and together they form an eerily unstoppable duo.

While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice.

Players compete for victory points, which come mainly from contracts (sets of resources) and special cards (like a collected set of 1-4 identical &quot;counting offices&quot;, the port rewarding collected ship cards etc.). The game is build on two core concepts:&#10;&#10;1. Players bid for cards by building &quot;towers&quot; with their meeples over them. Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players &quot;below&quot; it. This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more. This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round.&#10;&#10;2. Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards. Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory. By many players, the &quot;punishing&quot; mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld.&#10;&#10;The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn.

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards, or pass. To activate a goblin or draw cards, players need to spend 1-2 activation tokens, with them having only two at the start of each battle.

Each player is a waiter trying to deliver his stack of dishes before anyone else, with the dishes being represented by a stack of colored chips on a face-down card.&#10;&#10;Players each have a hand of cards, a few of which might be special action cards while the majority will be divided into two narrow rectangles.

The cards let you take actions like moving a token from one stack to another, with the primary action being to deliver food. When you deliver a dish, however, everyone with that type of dish on top of his stack gets to deliver it, so ideally you can first place a token on the opponent&rsquo;s stack in order to lock down that dish.&#10;&#10;You can also split your stack into two or more stacks, thereby giving you more opportunities to deliver dishes &ndash; but doing so reduces your hand size and limits the chances that you'll be able to do what you want!&#10;&#10;",4,30,13,2,30,Hey Waiter!,30,2010,Jennifer Vargas,Card,Anthony Rubbo,,"Hand Management,Partnerships",R&R Games,6.30405,262,2-3

They must choose an item depicted on one of the cards laying at the center of the table and use it to continue the story. Depending on how convincing they are to the teller, and how well they integrated their character and the item to the current twist, they get points in the shape of &quot;quill&quot; markers.

For the attacker, the challenge is the tough Sicilian terrain; and for the defenders, it&rsquo;s the worsening Italian morale.&#10;&#10;Each victory area and functioning port that the Allies secure adds a &lsquo;Fading Italian Morale&rsquo; Event Chit into the selection cup, and as each of those are drawn, worsening effects on Italian units are felt along the entire front.&#10;&#10;If one side has not secured an automatic victory by the end of turn 9, the Axis player receives bonuses, both for German units that have exited off the island through Messina and also for areas on Sicily that are still Axis-controlled, so there is pressure on both sides to fight for every area.&#10;&#10;Event Chits include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Replacements&#10;     Fading Italian Morale,&#10;     the Patton Soldier Slap, and&#10;     flanking battalion-sized invasions.&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,240,12,2,240,FAB: Sicily,240,2011,"Knut Grünitz,Rodger B.

68264,"(from GMT's website:)&#10;&#10;No Retreat: The Russian Front is a new deluxe edition of the  two-player Victory Point Games 2008 CSR Award Nominee wargame that retells the story of the titanic struggle between the invading armies of Nazi Germany versus Communist Russia during WW2 at a player-friendly and manageable level of scope and difficulty.  This edition combines both the original game and its two extensions (Na Berlin! and No Surrender!) using deluxe components of &ldquo;Twilight Struggle Deluxe Edition&rdquo; quality. With only 40 Army/Front sized counters for the Tournament game, and 70 for the whole campaign, and with very low stacking, it&rsquo;s a quick-playing yet realistic affair that favours the strategic and offensive-minded player.&#10;&#10;Each turn is alight with intriguing on-board challenges plus the surprise of card hand Events as players vie to win in one of three different ways.&#10;&#10;In a skillfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and modern card-driven simulations, No Retreat: The Russian Front  stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian&rsquo;s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought.&#10;&#10;Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     One Standard size mounted map&#10;     Two Counter Sheets&#10;     One deck of 55 Playing Cards&#10;     Rule booklet&#10;     Scenario booklet&#10;     Player Aid Cards&#10;     Two 6-sided dice (1 black and 1 white)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 2 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 100km / 60 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Armies and Fronts&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Carl Paradis&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Carl Paradis&#10;MAP ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;",2,360,12,1,360,No Retreat!

Opposing these lads are elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; (Hitler Youth) and Panzer Lehr&mdash;elite panzergrenadier units.  The goal of the British division is to seize the town of Fontenay, then press onward to secure the high ground near Rauray in time for the impending Operation Epsom, to be launched the next morning.&#10;&#10;The game by designer Mark Mokszycki uses the same system as Red Winter, his game on the Battle of Tolvaj&auml;rvi  from the Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939.  Scale is grand tactical: 90 minutes per game turn, 425 yards per hex, and mostly company sized infantry units with platoon sized armor units. Gone are the Winter War specific rules such as ski movement and night raids, and in their place we have a more detailed armor/anti-tank subsystem.  There are lots of tanks on both sides in this one!&#10;&#10;Rules for Operation Dauntless include the 12th SS Fanatical Defense Table, British sabot ammo, tank destroyers, self-propelled infantry guns and artillery, combat engineers, troop transport, British air strikes, German nuisance raids (night bombings), infantry anti-tank weapons, German ammo shortage, and abstracted effects of the immense British opening barrage by 650 guns.&#10; Terrain is a mixture of corn and wheat fields, orchards, woods, heavy and light bocage, and small stone farm houses and villages.  The Germans begin the game dug in, and they may place a limited number of fortifications during setup.&#10;&#10;The game includes a multi-day campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. The Germans are on the defensive overall, but they are armed to the teeth with many powerful panzer formations&mdash;including Panzer IVs, Panthers, and Tigers&mdash;and will find themselves able to counterattack frequently and effectively.

Sections of it, including the Canal de Garonne, remained unfinished until the 19th century.&#10;&#10;You can relive the adventure of building the canal, section by section, between Grisolles and Valence d'Agen in the heart of the Tarn-et-Garonne.

Your aim is to have the most workers on a stretch of canal when it is completed.  Ties are broken in favour of the player placed third. It is also possible to build locks to alter sections of the canal and create new ones. However, the number of points awarded depends on the length of the section: a lock may win you a majority, but at what price?&#10;&#10;Points can also be scored for building structures, though this sacrifices a worker (five maximum per player) for the rest of the game.

73245,"From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;In September 1944, Operation Market Garden was intended to open a direct path for the Allied armies to circumvent the West Wall and threaten Germany's industrial Ruhr heartland. British, American and Polish airborne forces were ordered to assault and capture key bridges along the main highway leading through Holland, the Arnhem bridge being the most distant of them all. Unfortunately, the Allies had gravely underestimated the strength of German forces in the area; so, when the airborne forces landed, they found themselves scattered amid an SS panzer division. The various bridges thus became the fulcrum of the entire operation for both sides.&#10;&#10;Arnhem utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by tanks &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy paratrooper battalion defending a landing zone. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the landing zone, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Arnhem, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting for Arnhem. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Arnhem&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,60,12,2,60,Arnhem: The Farthest Bridge,60,2010,"Eric R.

But in the end, who will be the most appreciated and respected for his status and his culture?&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to obtain more Volgare points. The players will gain VP from reading manuscripts, looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or &quot;The Riddle from Verona&quot;. Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope.

84864,"Insidious Sevens is a trick-taking game in which players predict how many tricks they will win each round. The deck consists of 40 cards, numbered 0-7 in five colors, with the colors ranked on the cards: purple (high), blue, green, yellow, red (low). Note that all 7s are higher than any 6, which are each higher than any 5, and so on.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player is dealt seven cards. Players pass 0-3 cards to their left or right neighbor depending on the round number. Players then predict the number of tricks they'll take by choosing a card in their hand and simultaneously revealing them. The player with the highest bid becomes start player for the round, and the color of that player's card indicates the trump suit for that round. These bidding cards are then returned to the players' hands.&#10;&#10;The start player for a trick lays down a card, and each player must follow the lead by playing a card of the same color or number. If this isn't possible, they can play any card. The highest trump card played (if any) wins the trick; otherwise the highest card played that followed the lead (including number!) wins the trick. After seven tricks, the round ends. Making one's bid nets two points plus the number of tricks bid, while missing results in a loss of one point for every under- or over-trick. The player with the highest score after seven rounds wins.&#10;&#10;An optional rule forbids the bids from summing to seven. If this occurs, the player with the highest bid scores one point, then the bid cards are set aside and players rebid from the cards remaining in hand. This process can repeat until the total of bids made does not equal seven.&#10;&#10;",5,30,9,2,30,Insidious Sevens,30,2010,Alex Weldon,Card,Alex Weldon,,Trick-taking,"Asmodee,MJ Games",6.46984,63,2-3

85897,"Thunderstone: Dragonspire is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire! Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!), and the all new &quot;Setting&quot; cards which alter the game on a global scale.

88871,"Roads to Moscow: Battles of Mozhaysk and Mtsensk, 1941 is a two-player game depicting battles in the Soviet Union during the drive on Moscow in October 1941. The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.&#10;&#10;Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.&#10; Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations.

Four blue and three green scoring spaces are scattered on the track, and four summit spaces are found at the end of the track. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards, with cards coming in ten colors to match those of the dragons; each player also starts with a uniquely-colored card face-up on the table to indicate which dragon the player is riding.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player lays down one card from his hand, then advances the appropriately-colored dragon as many spaces as the number shown on the card. If another player has a card of this color in front of her, the player places the card on that player's stack; if not, the player places the card on his own stack, effectively changing steeds if the color differs from what was on top previously. (Exception: If a dragon not being ridden by anyone is in last place, the player may choose to place the card under his stack instead of on top of it, while moving the dragon normally.)&#10;&#10;If a dragon moves onto a blue space, then each dragon on a space valued three or less scores that many points for the player riding that dragon, if any. If a dragon moves onto a green space, then each player scores points equal to the value of the space on which his dragon stands. If a player causes no scoring on his turn or plays his last card in hand, he refills his hand to six cards; if he caused a scoring, then he draws no card and plays with a smaller hand next turn.&#10;&#10;When a dragon moves onto one of the four summit spaces, all dragons score points (possibly negative) for their riders.

On a turn, a player first rolls all five dice, sets aside at least one die, then rerolls, with the process continuing at most five times, at which points all the dice will be set aside. The player discards all 6s, then for each other value he places 1-2 chips onto the game board, mostly from his hand but sometimes from the stock.&#10;&#10;If a player completes a column by filling in the red circle, he claims all the chips in this column and every other player must remove 1-3 chips in his supply from the game.

90142,"Tricky Bid is a trick-taking game in which half the cards in hand will be used for bidding and the other half for tricks.&#10;&#10;Before each trick, each player takes turns placing a card face-up on the table, which represents his bid for that trick. The player who leads then plays a card, and each player follows suit if possible, with the highest card on suit (or the highest trump, if one was played) winning the trick. The cards in the trick are thrown away, however, and the winner of the trick keeps only his bid card and all other bid cards of the same color. Since bidding is done in turn order, all but the starting player can decide to join in on a bid (by playing a card of the same color as the lead player, thereby raising the stakes) or start a bid in a new color.&#10;&#10;Players score points based on the bid cards they collect, and the player with the most points after each person has dealt once wins the game.&#10;&#10;",4,30,12,2,30,Tricky Bid,30,2011,(Uncredited),Card,Hilko Drude,,"Auction/Bidding,Trick-taking",Winning Moves Germany,6.19063,80,2-3
90305,"In Serge Laget's Cargo Noir &ndash; his fourth standalone box game from Days of Wonder &ndash; players represent &quot;families&quot; that traffic in smuggled goods in a 1950s noir setting. Each turn, you'll set sail to various ports where cargo is known to get &quot;lost&quot; for the right price &ndash; Hong Kong, Bombay, Rotterdam, New York and more &ndash; and you'll make an offer for the goods on display. If another family then offers more in that port, you'll need to up your bid or take your money and slink away to look for goods elsewhere. Stand alone in a port, though, and you'll be able to discretely move the goods from the dock to your personal warehouse. Says Laget in a press release accompanying the game announcement, &quot;Everything in Cargo Noir grew from a core auction mechanism that is simple and trivial to explain &ndash; you can only bid up, and the last bidder standing gets the goods.&quot;&#10;&#10;Once you collect goods, you can trade them in to add more ships to your fleet &ndash; allowing you to scout for wares in more locations &ndash; purchase Victory Spoils, or take other actions.

Well, to be honest the landscape holds a few donkeys, too, and while donkeys can help carry all that gold, they'll also eat into your savings if you aren't careful.&#10;&#10;Gold! consists of a 60-card deck, with cards in six colors; each color has gold cards valued 3-8 and a few donkeys worth -2. Each player starts the game with a different-colored donkey, then two cards are removed from play and five cards laid out face-up. On a turn, a player must do one of the following three actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Take the lowest valued card on display, with donkeys always being worth less than gold, and add it to his tableau.&#10;&bull; Exchange one gold card from his tableau for a lower-valued gold card.&#10;&bull; Exchange a donkey from his tableau for a gold card of any value.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player collects three cards of the same color, he must score it.

91010,"Phantom Fury - The 2nd Battle for Fallujah&#10;This solitaire game simulates, at tactical scale, the combat waged by US forces during the month of November 2004 to secure the city of Fallujah and crush insurgent resistance. The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.&#10;&#10;The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.&#10;&#10;The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.&#10;&#10;The troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.&#10;&#10;Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.&#10;&#10;At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&bull; 17x22 map&#10;&#10;&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters&#10;&#10;&bull;  1 player aid&#10;&#10;&bull; 1 die&#10;&#10;&bull; Rule booklet&#10;&#10;",1,240,12,1,240,Phantom Fury,240,2011,Thomas Pouchin,"Modern Warfare,Wargame",Laurent Closier,Solitaire Wargames,"Area Movement,Chit-Pull System,Dice Rolling",Nuts!

91189,"In Ristorante Italia, each player owns an Italian restaurant, a restaurant that he wants to make better than everyone else's in order to have the most points at the end of the game. To do this, a player must set up the menu, draw recipe cards, go to the town markets to collect needed ingredients, improve and enlarge the restaurant, improve the staff's cooking skills (as indicated by the cook-o-meter), and otherwise do whatever is necessary to have the most exemplary restaurant in the city.&#10;&#10;Ristorante Italia lasts four phases, with each phase being comprised of three rounds. In each round, players can perform two actions from this list: draw recipe/wine cards, buy ingredients, buy rooms, take a &quot;personal touch&quot; cube, buy a bonus card, or buy a cooking training course. Special events during the game include VIP visits, culinary reviewer visits and the final National Cooking Contest, in which players will compete with their best recipes.&#10;&#10;To achieve victory, players can follow an economic strategy &ndash; focusing on a menu which provides a strong revenue &ndash; or a quality strategy, in which the restaurant features special recipes matched to unique wines.

In Bright Got 'Em you outsmart and corner your opponents through savvy card play, sly movement, and clever placement of blocking walls. In the still-casual, but even-trickier Brainy Got 'Em! you toss aside card actions in favor of a purely strategic challenge.&#10;&#10;Both games share the same goal, the same exciting intrigue, and the same social fun. &#10;Place walls to trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours!&#10;&#10;Surround yourself with friends and family. Get ready to enjoy mroe fun than any four walls could ever contain! It's time you Got 'Em!&#10;Play Summary:&#10;The goal: trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours. Last pawn free wins!&#10;&#10;Bright Got 'Em! (use colored side of the board)&#10;In Bright Got 'Em!, each player starts with 3 cards and pawn. Place your pawn on the same-colored start square (one of the four squares at the corners of the board's center square). The player who's birthday is closest, goes first.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will play a card, following each rule in the order they appear. Most cards have 2 instructions. The first tells you where you can place a wall and the second how many square you can move your pawn.&#10;&#10;Wall Placement Rules:&#10;Walls can only be placed along one edge of a square, between two squares.&#10;When a player's pawn is trapped by walls in a single square, that player is eliminated from the game. The edge of the board counts as a wall.&#10;There are a few cards that allow you to remove a wall or pass through a wall. However, you have to play these cards before your pawn is trapped! &#10;Once your pawn is trapped in a single square, you're out and your pawn is removed from the board.&#10;When you trap another player's pawn, thus eliminating him from the game, you may remove any 1 wall from the board.&#10;&#10;Moving Your Pawn&#10;Most cards allow you to move your pawn up to a specific number of squares.&#10;You can't move through walls, unless you play a card that allows it.&#10;You can't move through a square occupied by another pawn.&#10;You may only move orthogonally, never diagonally.&#10;You can stay where you are.&#10;You don't have to move the exact number of squares listed on the card. You can move fewer squares if you want.&#10;You can move zig zag, first in one direction, then in another, just not diagonally up to the number of squares specified on the card you played.&#10;&#10;After placing a wall and moving (or not), discard the card you played and draw another. (You should always have 3 cards in your hand.) Play passes to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;The last player to have a pawn on the board wins!&#10;&#10;Brainy Got 'Em! (use white side of board)&#10;You don't need any cards for this version. The goal is the same: trap your opponents' pawns while illuding capture yourself.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a wall anywhere on the board, then move your pawn.&#10;The number of squares you can move your pawn is equal to 1 plus the number of walls on your square. You may place a wall on the square your pawn occupies to increase your pawn's movement on the same turn.&#10;&#10;All other rules are the same as Bright Got 'Em!&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 double-sided game board (Bright Got 'Em! on one side, Brainy Got 'Em! on the other), 84 wall pieces, 55 Got 'Em! cards, 4 pawns, game rules.&#10;&#10;",4,30,8,2,30,Got 'Em!,30,2012,"Sarah Baynes,Ilonka Sauciuc",Strategy,"Tyler Bielman,Jonathon Loucks,Zach Weisman",,"Area Control / Area Influence,Area Enclosure,Hand Management",Calliope Games,6.21216,74,2-3

Construction is not enough: you also have to ensure your presence in the great spheres of power. It is up to you and your opponents to build Qu&eacute;bec City in your colors!&#10;&#10;A game takes place over four centuries. Each player plays on average 5 to 7 turns per century. On each turn, players choose one of these actions :&#10;&#10;     Start a new building with his architect&#10;     Complete part of a building&#10;     Send a worker to a zone of influence&#10;     Take a leader card&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;By contributing to the numerous buildings, players acquire influence with the authorities of the time : religion, politics, commerce and culture. Players also help build the famous Citadelle.&#10;&#10;At the end of each century, there is a scoring round where players get victory points for the workers they managed to send in the 5 zones of influence. Qu&eacute;bec introduces a unique and addictive majority rule. The player with the majority in a zone cascades half of his workers by moving them to the next zone. Workers moved in this way allow a player to score even more points. If a player still has the majority in the next zone, his workers cascade again &ndash; a potentially devastating ripple effect. This mechanism illustrates the interrelationship between the great zones of influence. Players must not only fight to get majorities, they must also erect the most prestigious buildings.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fourth century. Players then receive points for the buildings they completed.

This often-overlooked conflict ended in a draw historically, but this was not the only possible outcome. The Americans clearly wished to annex Canada to their young nation, while the British wanted to teach their former colonies a lesson. The game includes all of the theaters of battle from the war: the US/ Canadian border and the Great Lakes (of course) but also the wilderness of the old Northwest, the Atlantic coast of the US, the Civilized Indians of the south, and the site of the final conflict at New Orleans.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents a few months of time (depending on the season). A typical turn consists of dealing out to each player the number of cards indicated on the turn track. The winter and spring turns require a few special tasks. The Americans will have more resources to commit to the war- until Napoleon is defeated in Europe, and the English player can focus more resources on their efforts in North America. Each card can be played for the event described on the card, or for the card&rsquo;s Operations Points, to move Expeditions, build ships and fortifications, or raise troops.&#10;&#10;Events on the cards and on the map will cause the markers on the Peace Track to move forward.

With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!&#10;&#10;Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players. Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.&#10;&#10;Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.&#10;&#10;While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design.

Napol&eacute;on was able to reconstitute an army of 300,000 men by summoning to the colors those young soldiers who soon came to be called by the name &laquo; Marie-Louise &raquo;. Europe formed a coalition against France: Prussia and Russia wanted to crush Napol&eacute;on permanently. Despite his victories during the spring and summer, Austria soon joined the side of the Empire&rsquo;s enemies.

The idea for this and future volumes is that we will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and GMT production.&#10;&#10;The Napoleonic 20 game system from Victory Point Games features lower-level wargame complexity on maps where, generally, 20 pieces or fewer are in play at one time (total, for both sides).  This creates tense, dramatic and fast-playing situations on the board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. Subscribers to C3i have recently enjoyed Jena 20, a game in this series which features eight pages of Standard rules and one-to-two pages of exclusive rules per title.&#10; Veteran game designer Joe Miranda, with developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, have created and refined a highly popular game series that is growing all the time. (Based on Joe's series rules, Alan, Lance, and Steve Carey have each designed one of the games in this multi-pack - in addition to Joe's Waterloo game.) A hallmark feature is the use of narrative random event cards that help &ldquo;tell the stories&rdquo; unique to each battle and small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuvers, combat, and even lulls, provide players a fun exercise in the Napoleonic parry-and-thrust of grand battles as armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first.&#10;&#10;This edition includes the latest version (3.0) of the Standard series rules.&#10; Morale plays an vital role, as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to a key attack or defense.

101118,"Summary from Columbia Games website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Borodino was fought between the Army of Imperial Russia and Napoleon's Grand Armee on September 7 1812. The battle ended with a French victory, but strategic defeat. Losses were terrible on both sides, but the Russians could replace theirs. One week after the battle Napoleon occupied an undefended Moscow, hoping to impose a peace, but after four weeks was forced to retreat home with calamitous results.&#10;&#10;The historical battle involved wave after wave of frontal attacks by both sides, focusing on the Russian redoubts. However, the game will show all the options available to Napoleon and Kutuzov, including some not attempted historically.

The tactical interaction of Napoleonic infantry, cavalry and artillery is also emphasized, including cavalry charges and squares.

101206,"During the night of 5-6 june 1944, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were to be parachuted behind Utah Beach in order to secure the approaches to the beach for the first wave of the landing forces. The sector had been flooded by the Germans, transofrmaing streams and lowlands into swamps and increasing the strategic value of the bridges and roads of the region. Of these, the two bridges located in the commune of Chef-du-Pont and the crossroads of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise are of primary importance for the Allies. In fact, withouth capturing them, it would be impossible to advance quickly into the Cotentin Peninsula and enlarge the bridgehead.&#10;&#10;The paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne need to be dropped onto three Drop Zones: The 505th PIR to the northwest of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise, the 507th PIR to the north of Amfreville, and the 508th PIR to the south of Amfreville. The Americans did have some reservations about the chances of success of this airborne operation. The landing zones were surrounded by several swamps and the smallest error would lead to heavy losses. The most pessimistic predictions had the casualty rate at 80%.&#10;&#10;While flying over the Cotentin, the troop transports were fired upon by German anti-aircraft defenses and thrown into disorder. Some pilots broke formation and gave the order to jump before the drop zones had been reached, leaving many parachutists dozens of kilometers away from their objectives. The less fortunate landed in the swampland and drowned in their heavy equipment. More than three-quarter of paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to, leading to the complete disorganization of the American troops dropped over France. This general state of disorder resulted in a series of clashes all over southeastern Cotentin. The Germans, themselves disorganized, limited their engagements against an enemy force whose objectives and strength remained unknown.&#10;&#10;Despite an extremely high rate of losses (more than 50% during the night of 6 June 1944 alone), the American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions accomplished a great deal of their assigned missions. The Germans, disorganized by the chaos, were incapable of counter-attacking. The landing could begin.&#10;&#10;Night Drop simulates the first hours of June 1944 and focuses on the operations conducted by the 82nd Us Airborne division. During the first (night time) game turns, the American player had to regroup his scattered forces in order to re-form companies and regiments. as long as this reorganization remains undone, American troops remain very vulnerable and the american player cannot know which objectives are in priority.&#10;&#10;The German player can use the opportunity to create even more disorder in the American ranks, or chase after isolated paratroopers. But the surprise of the airborne assault keeps the Germans blind to the objectives of their adversaries. As daylight comes, the German player slowly begins to learn the intentions of the American troops and can better organize as reinforcements arrive.&#10;&#10;For the American player, the knowledge of his objectives and the strength of his units give him the advantage over his enemies. The superiority from which he benefits allows him to bluff his opponent by attacking lesser important objectives, obliging the German player to make some critical choices: continue to defend a hex of middling importance and risk abandoning a more important hex, or focus on defending more important hexes and risk having been &quot;fooled&quot; by the enemy! The randomness of the drop, the priority assigned to each objective, and the arrival of German reinforcements assures a different game each time.&#10;&#10;140 counters&#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; map&#10;6 pages rules booklet&#10;&#10;Scale: 1 counter = 1 American company or 1 German section/company&#10;1 game turn = 1 hour&#10;1 hex = 400 meters&#10;&#10;(source: publisher's description)&#10;&#10;",2,180,0,2,180,Night Drop: 6 June 44,180,2012,Olivier Revenu,"Wargame,World War II",Laurent Closier,"Country: France,Magazine: Battles",Hex-and-Counter,Battles Magazine,7.3783,53,2-3

104347,"Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution! The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.&#10;&#10;In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &quot;broker&quot;, but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &quot;connections&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, nine locals &ndash; the Cubans &ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &ndash; one for each type of good &ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.&#10;&#10;All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)&#10;&#10;If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.&#10;&#10;After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs.

Devastated by the nuclear exchange, the remnants of America&rsquo;s once mighty military, aided by a smattering of their NATO allies, fight against a horde of ravenous predators including Cuba, Nicaragua, and their Central/Southern American allies, hoping against hope to hold their country until the last vestiges of their mighty European army returns home.&#10;&#10;Command formations of Nicaraguan T-72s against American M-48s, fight Cuban T-62s with Canadian Centurions, and battle against Soviet Spetsnaz with the indomitable French Foreign Legion.

106999,"There's still much left to do in order to become the world's largest and most diverse amusement park! Your family (one of four) has a small, but steady income that should suffice to hire a few showmen to bring life to the oh-so-empty park site. As you earn more, you can afford a favor or two: the police officer is kinder to you, you can hire a migrant worker to do extra work, and you can even finagle the attention of a promoter or a journalist!&#10;&#10;The families will need to co-operate from time to time; after all, those grand attractions don't build themselves. In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!&#10;&#10;To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income. A player can never have more than five money tiles and five materials.&#10;&#10;A player then takes one to three main actions and up to five special actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a building site tile. Pay the cost of the space you cover and receive the reward shown there (VPs, materials, an additional action)&#10;    Place a showmen tile. Pay the cost in building materials shown on your player board, then place this tile on an empty space on a building site. This boosts your income (by uncovering a space) and gives you and others potential places to build.&#10;    Place a grand attraction tile. These tiles cost 2-5 materials to build and cover 1-4 spaces, each of which must have a showman tile on it. Players receive points for their showmen used or attraction placed, then the showmen are returned to the appropriate player boards.&#10;&#10;&#10;By spending two money, a player can acquire one of five character tiles (either from the supply or another player); each character provides a special action that the player can use each turn, such as spending money or VPs for material or buying newspaper tiles (which are worth points and can be spent for an additional action).&#10;&#10;Each main action may be executed at most once per turn unless extra actions are used from newspapers or from bonuses earned by placing certain building site tiles.&#10;&#10;After one player reaches 60 VP, and each player has had the same number of turns, the game ends, with players scoring their newspaper tiles and losing points for each showman on their player boards.

107635,"In the bustling market of Cairo, traders build their stalls and try to entice customers with attractive goods, with each customer bringing money that the trader can then use to expand that stall or establish new stalls.&#10;&#10;To set up Kairo, players first take turns placing three colored stalls (out of six) on the game board. They also take three stall cards (which highlight one or more sections on the game board) and one coin of each of the six colors. Five colored customers start at particular locations on the game board, with the sixth customer placed to the side. On a turn, a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draws two cards (face-up or face-down stall cards or market barker cards).&#10;    Moves a customer to a stall of that customer's color.&#10;    Plays a stall card; then builds a new stall, expands an existing stall, or moves a blocked-off stall.&#10;&#10;&#10;The active player can choose to move any customer, and that customer will move to the closest stall (measured on orthogonal paths) of the same color. Additionally, this player can choose to play one or more market barker cards to &quot;call&quot; the customer past one or more stalls, presumably to bring the customer to that player's own stall. If the active player owns the visited stall, he receives one coin of the stall's color for each tile in that stall; if not, the active player receives a one coin commission while the owner receives the normal payout. This customer is then swapped with the customer off the board.&#10;&#10;When building a new stall, a player cannot place it in the same region as another stall of the same color. Regulations! Restaurants must be placed in an area designated for them, while all other stalls must go in the market area. When expanding an existing stall, the player must pay one coin of the same color for each tile in the enlarged stall. By expanding, you can earn more coins when customers visit, create longer paths to opponents' stalls, reserve area in which to expand further, and (most importantly) earn victory points. You score VPs each time you expand, and if your stall is the largest (or tied for the largest) of that color, you'll take one or two medals that provide a VP bonus.&#10;&#10;Once the expansions run low in one or two colors, players can only build or expand.

It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.&#10;&#10;The game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.&#10;&#10;Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811&#10;The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811&#10;On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.&#10;&#10;El Bodon 25th September 1811&#10;The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:&#10;&#10;    A 59 x 40 cm map,&#10;    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,&#10;    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Units : Regiments and brigades&#10;Map scale : 500 m/hex.&#10;Turn : 120 minutes&#10;&#10;Complexity : 6 / 9&#10;&#10;Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).&#10;&#10;",0,240,0,2,240,Fuentes de Onoro 1811,240,2011,Pascal da Silva,"Napoleonic,Wargame",Frédéric Bey,"Country: Portugal,Jours de Gloire Series","Chit-Pull System,Hex-and-Counter",Vae Victis,8.03243,74,2-3

The creatures already on the board progress towards the side of the board using a totally automatic way of moving. New creatures (1 to 3, depending on a dice roll) arrive on the board and start to progress too.&#10;     Preparation of the Action tiles. The six Action tiles are shuffled and placed one by one forming a line, face up. These tiles represent all possible actions, each tile being separated into a major and a minor action. The number of places available on the tiles depends on the number of players.&#10;     Choice of actions. Each druid team carries out 5 actions a round, represented by Action markers. Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).&#10;     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out. The actions on the next Action tile are then carried out and so on, until all major or all minor actions have been performed. Then, the players come back to the stopped action to perform it. Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council. Any druid can start from the council to enter back the path, but he can also stay at the council to influence it and gain MP at the end of the round.&#10;     Activation of magical stones. At the end of each round, all stones that are aligned and of the same colour automatically become menhirs.

Menhirs have a special property that will be activated at the end of the game.&#10;     Druid council. At the end of each round, the influence of each druid team on the council is evaluated. Players receive as many MP as their number of druids at the council.

112092,"Haven Town is facing total annihilation at the hands (and teeth) of a horde of monsters from beyond the Shadowrift.&#10;&#10;You, the heroes, must band together to drive them back. To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Luckily for you, Shadowrift is a deck-building game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck, cards that will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes. Unlike other deck-builders, there is constant interaction with your fellow players as you figure out who will gain which benefit from the limited supply of townsfolk, offer their coin to help construct walls, and seek healing from anyone who's learned such magic.&#10;&#10;Shadowrift also features monsters that don't merely sit waiting to be slain; if you leave them alone, they will rip Haven Town asunder. They'll kill people, break walls, and kick your heroes in the face. Combat with them is intuitive (though frequently painful). For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Shadowrift features many improved mechanisms, including a revised system for how monsters choose who to attack (based on types of villagers, instead of specific people) and a new system for monster powers (making them much more dangerous). It also has a revised card layout and a great deal of new and improved artwork.&#10;&#10;",6,120,14,1,45,Shadowrift,120,2012,"Enggar Adirasa,Kirsten Brown,Colin Epstein,Ross Grams,Tomasz Jedruszek,Nicholas Kay,Tom Kelly,Andy Kluthe,Philip X.

112118,"RED is a three-colored tile-laying game for three players. The three colors in the game are black, white, and red, and each player will be a different color. Each tile has a background color and a different-colored circle in the middle. There are 6 different combinations and 5 small tiles and 1 large tile for each combination.&#10;&#10;Players place tiles on the table trying to connect groups of their border color and groups of their circle color.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;Place all the tiles face-up in a pool, leaving room to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player is assigned one of the three colors by some agreeable method and takes the corresponding counter; the counters just show which player is which color. The order of play is White player, then Black, then Red. Players take turns placing any tile from the pool on the playing surface according to the following rules:&#10;&#10;- Tiles must be placed so that they align with an imaginary grid of squares the size of the small tiles.&#10;&#10;- White cannot play a large tile on the first turn.&#10;&#10;- Except for the obvious exception of the first tile, each new tile must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one small tile (i.e. must touch a small tile). Just having the corners touch isn't good enough.&#10;&#10;- A large tile cannot be placed orthogonally adjacent to another large tile (that is, no two large tiles can touch each other, except at the corners).&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no available moves.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;&#10;Small tiles count as 1 point, and large tiles count as 2 points.&#10;&#10;Find the largest connected group of tiles with your border color, and then find the largest connected group of tiles with your circle color.

114261,"That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged is a solitaire game covering the pivotal World War II years of the mid-1940 through 1942 period in the often overlooked Battle for the Mediterranean. You are placed in the role of the Commonwealth Commander in the theatre, and must utilize every resource at your disposal to fend off unrelenting Axis attacks in order to ensure the survival of the island of Malta.&#10;&#10;Built upon the same States of Siege engine as the designer's previous 2010 Charles S. Roberts award-winning release (We Must Tell the Emperor), Malta Besieged features both familiar and innovative game play. Supply was the key element in the Mediterranean Campaign, and so it is here as well. Players will have to safely shepherd vulnerable convoys - and their valuable cargoes - in order to effectively wage war. With the ability to trade Supply for extra Actions at the most crucial moments, this places an additional emphasis on that precious resource and also creates extremely tense convoy battles which will resolve as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;ULTRA is a crucial asset in the game, but beware of Axis counterintelligence! Spitfires can rule the skies, Gibraltar can block U-Boat advances, Operation Herkules is a constant threat, and Admiral Cunningham himself can intervene on occasion.&#10;&#10;North Africa is not treated as a mere sideshow; indeed, the struggle with Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, holds the ultimate key to victory... if Malta can hold out against the constant pressure. If a fortified Tobruk manages to stubbornly delay the vaunted Afrika Korps long enough, then General Montgomery and his battle-tested 8th Army can possibly make a final dash from El Alamein to capture Tripoli and secure a glorious triumph.&#10;&#10;Raiding Axis supply lines to weaken Rommel's Situation, scrambling Hurricanes to provide Air Support for inbound shipping, attacking the Italians early before the dreaded Luftwaffe arrives, requesting British Fleet escort for your individually named convoys, and maintaining the morale of a battered Malta are just some of the important decisions to be made throughout the game. Numerous theatre-wide events such as The Fall of France, O'Connor's desert offensive, the daring raid on the Italian Fleet at Taranto, the Air Assault on Crete, the evacuation from Greece, the sinking of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, and the Torch landings are all abstracted via card play, and can have a significant impact on the overall conduct of the war.&#10;&#10;With That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged, it's all here - the only question is will you have the wisdom, leadership, fortitude, and luck to prevail?

The objective is to connect five (or more) of one's tiles, including at least one of each type, together (sides and corners count).  Additionally, all five (or more) tiles must be face-up, or unactivated.  The game ends immediately when a player achieves this goal.

Finely-detailed wall and tower pieces link together to form courtyards, and the player who finishes a courtyard claims it with a Keep, scoring points for that courtyard equal to the number of tower pieces surrounding it.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player starts the game with two decks of cards: a wall deck and a tower deck.

On a turn, a player can play as many cards as she wants, but she draws only one card at the end of her turn. The goal is to create courtyards &ndash; and subdivide existing courtyards &ndash; while keeping your opponent from doing the same.

116954,"Indigo is a tile-laying game along the lines of Metro, Tsuro, and Linie 1 in which players build paths bit by bit, with no player owning the individual paths and everyone trying to exploit the paths already present. Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move gemstones from their starting locations on the board to your designated goals, with the player who scores the most points winning the game.&#10;&#10;To set up the game board, place the central hex tile, then add five green gems and one indigo gem to it. Place six &quot;U-turn&quot; tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone &quot;moves&quot; as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. (Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.) When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection.&#10;&#10;If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!&#10;&#10;When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem.

To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants. It's all up to you &ndash; but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin...&#10;&#10;",5,180,14,2,120,Yedo,180,2012,Franz Vohwinkel,Strategy,"Thomas Vande Ginste,Wolf Plancke","Asian Theme,Country: Japan","Action / Movement Programming,Auction/Bidding,Hand Management,Set Collection,Worker Placement","eggertspiele,IDW Games,IELLO,Pandasaurus Games,Pegasus Spiele",7.50024,2553,2-3

In fact, Button Up! is an abstract game in which players try to manipulate the button troops to score more points than the opponent.&#10;&#10;To set up each round of the game, randomly arrange nine buttons in a circle: three red for Buttonaparte, three black for Von York Buttonburg, and three neutral white spies. On a turn, the active player takes one stack that contains a spy, then distributes that stack clockwise one button at a time, with the buttons coming off the bottom of the stack as they're placed. Thus, the first move is a single white button being placed on its neighbor to the left; if that stack is moved on the second turn, the bottom button is placed on its left neighbor, then the white button on top placed to the left of that. If the last button placed matches color with the button it covers, the player who moved it takes another turn.

120669,"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Following on the success of No Retreat: The Russian Front, where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, Victory Point Games' dynamic duo of game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up again to present the second chapter in this game series, No Retreat: The North African Front. This time they take the gaming action to the African Front, from the start of Operation Compass on 8 December 1940, through 1942 to the eviction of the Axis from Libya.&#10;&#10;Building on the notion of a card assisted game and death-or-glory victory conditions, No Retreat: The North African Front offers a narrative game rich in the feel for the ebb-and-flow of the campaign, wrapped around an exciting maneuver and combat system that harkens back to the glory days of classic wargaming, but includes all the modern features and plenty of innovations. Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 &quot;mini-maps&quot; located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating &quot;mini-games&quot; in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.&#10;&#10;This Deluxe Edition combines both the original game, featuring Five quick-playing scenarios, a Tournament Game, a Full-Fledged Campaign game, and a Bonus &quot;Invasion of Crete&quot; mini-game, all using deluxe components of &quot;Twillight Struggle Deluxe Edition&quot; quality.&#10;&#10;The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.&#10;&#10;The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.&#10;&#10;The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake. You must endure and prevail under the most surprising and grueling of circumstances, for there is No Retreat!&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;&#10;No Retreat: The Invasion of Crete&#10;This Bonus mini-game will allow you to refight the first airborne invasion in history, during May 1941. Each player will fight to gain or maintain control of the Island's critical 3 airfields. Time is of the essence here as each contestant has to manage his limited ressources in a life-or-death contest where neither has space to Retreat! This is a very intense knife-fight that can be very well be decided in the few first days, while the German Airborne force is most vulnerable, or could turn into a desperate rear-guard action, as the hard-pressed Allied troops try to escape the island. An innovative pre-game set-up planning procedure, and Airborne Landing rules, will insure that no two games play the same.&#10;&#10;Scenario Listing:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Compass, 1940: The British surprise offensive against the unprepared Italians in Lybia, pushing them back over 300 miles and capturing 115,000 prisoners!  This scenario makes an excellent tutorial due to its low unit density. It is essentially a race game, with the Allies rushing to reach Map 2 and win the game there.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Sunflower, 1941: Rommel arrives in Africa with the 21st Panzer Division and begins operations to roll back the recent Allied advances, thanks to the withdrawal of their best troops to fight in Greece. Can you capture the important Port/Fortress of Tobruk, or will you to be stopped by the tenacious Australians?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Crusader, 1941: The importance of Tobruk and pressure from Malta on the Axis convoy routes to Africa caused both sides to fully commit to winning the war in the western desert during the British all-out attack to relieve the siege of the embattled Fortress. It's a wild free-for all battle, where speed of manoeuvre is all-important.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Venezia, 1942: After capturing Tobruk in this operation and routing the Allied forces in the desert (and the cancellation of the Malta Invasion), the German High Command sends resources to help Rommel&rsquo;s exhausted forces race to Egypt. Can the forces of the Commonwealth hold the line at El-Alamein, or will the Afrika Corps reach Alexandria and the Suez Canal?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Lightfoot 1942: The last-ditch defence of Egypt and the resulting stalemate at El Alamein was finally turned to victory for the Allies as Monty&rsquo;s overwhelming force pushed back the depleted and badly-supplied Axis Divisions. Or maybe Rommel will be able again to outmanoeuvre the British foe, and turn this battle of attrition into another of his famous victories? &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A Tournament Scenario 1941: For players that have time to play more than a scenario, but not enough for the full-fledged campaign game.  Action starts with the first Rommel Attack of Operation Sunflower, and continues until Operation Crusader the end of 1941.

No, wait &ndash; awesome customers who have done great things that inspire others to come drink with them and your tavern. Thus, you're going to support adventurers on their quests to do great things, which will ideally bring renown upon you and your tavern in the end.&#10;&#10;In game terms, each player starts with a hand of adventurers and some coins. Two or three quests are laid out face-up, and each quest shows the strength of the adventurer party &ndash; in terms of warrior, wizard, cleric and rogue &ndash; required to complete the quest. On a turn, you draw two adventurers cards, then play any number of cards (including zero) &ndash; paying their costs at the same time &ndash; in order to complete quests and gain the income and renown associated with it. When a quest is completed, all other adventurer cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;Why not just hold adventurers in hand until you can send out a massive party all at once? Your tavern is tiny at the start of the game, so you need to keep sending out adventurers in order to make room for more. As you gain renown, though, you'll increase the size of your tavern and have room to hold more adventurers in wait.

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, use a goblin's power, draw cards, or pass. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles.

Whoever ends up with the biggest stack of loot at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player secretly takes one of the five burglar tiles, which come in five different colors; each player also receives 2-4 helping hand tokens. Five locations are set out, each with two randomly chosen equipment tokens next to them; equipment tokens come in five types, with each type appearing in the five colors of the burglars. Special tokens are placed out as well: two loot tokens next to the bank, one lock on the museum, and one tunnel next to the manor; six additional loot tokens, along with a car token and the second tunnel, are placed to the side. Three randomly drawn equipment tokens are placed face up.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, the matchmaker determines the alliances for that round, placing two alliance markers &ndash; each showing a burglar in the appropriate color &ndash; in one area and the other three in the other area. Thus, the burglars form provisional teams for the round and are trying to work together to rob a location &ndash; any location! &ndash; but they don't necessarily know who's who. On a turn a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Chooses one of the face-up equipment tokens, places it next to a location (with no more than three tokens of the same type being allowed at a location), then reveals a new equipment token.&#10;    Draws the top equipment token from the stack, then places it at a location.&#10;    Plays a helping hand token to move a special token or add a new special token to a location.&#10;&#10;&#10;As soon as all five types of equipment are at a location, a burglary takes place there. Who steals the goods? The alliance that has the larger presence there based on the colors of tokens. These tokens are then flipped face down (becoming loot), added to any loot tokens present there, then split among the burglars in the alliance and placed on the scoreboard. The matchmaker token passes to a new player, who must move at least two alliance tokens, then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The special tokens naturally change the rules: The location with the lock cannot be robbed, although someone can choose to move the lock so that a burglary does take place.

129122,"Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII. It covers the exploits of the German 11th Panzer Division in Russia from 1941 to 1944. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.&#10;&#10;Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic. There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression. This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something. You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play. In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;Ghost Panzer is a STAND ALONE GAME, but is also the second in a series.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles was the first in the series and followed the U.S. 101st Airborne Division.&#10;&#10;Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.&#10;&#10;Other Key Links:&#10;&#10;Designing a Division&#10;&#10;",2,90,8,2,90,Band of Brothers:  Ghost Panzer,90,2013,"Michael Evans (II),Christopher Ono,Brandon Pennington,Dan Safee","Wargame,World War II",Jim Krohn,"Band of Brothers,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter","Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Modular Board","Worthington Games,Worthington Publishing, LLC",8.2305,230,2-3

Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue.

The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet.

Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013.

131393,"Early in the morning of May 10, 1940, under the Codeword Danzig, Fallschirmj&auml;ger from the 7th Flieger Division and 22nd Luftlande executed surprise landings at Den Haag, on the road to Rotterdam and against the Fortress of Eben Emael in order to facilitate German Army Group B's feint advance in Belgium, while the main attack was conducted by stronger Army Group A led by seven panzer divisions from the Ardennes, through a terrain believed uncrossable to armor units. France and the UK reacted immediately, activating the Dyle-Breda Plan, and thus committing their best forces directly into the trap. Then in June the evacuation of Dunkirk was a partial success, but the battle for France was over with an astonishing German victory. Four years elapsed before the Western Allies would come back to the continent and thus finally defeat Germany.&#10;&#10;Blocks in the West (BITW) recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the European Theater Front from the invasion of France until the collapse of the Nazi regimen in May 1945. BITW is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the operational level. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II on the Western Front. The game is recommended for two, three or four players: one/two control the Western Allies and the other one/two control Germany and Italy. The game is imminently suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, playing with Fog of War is mandatory.&#10;&#10;Developed on a wooden blocks and cubes system over an astonishing 124x87cm full-laminated multicolor map board, Blocks in the West includes no paper components other than the manual. All of the over 900 wooden/plastic components/stickers have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted A buratto, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories. In terms of scale, a hexagon is approximately 44 miles (70 km) across, a game turn is one month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally a corps) of ca. 30,000 men, 300 Tanks or 300 planes depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time. The basic game rules introduce the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember. Then the advanced game rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of fuel and the advanced production system. Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, optional rules can be added as desired; these include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, and Parachute Assaults.&#10;&#10;Blocks in the West can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the East and Blocks in Afrika.&#10;&#10;",4,120,14,1,120,Blocks in the West,120,2013,"Elisa Ferrotto,Emanuele Santandrea","Wargame,World War II",Emanuele Santandrea,"Block wargames,Blocks Series","Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Simulation",VentoNuovo Games,8.3125,76,2-3

Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&#10;&#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&#10;&#10;The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&#10;&#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&#10;&#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&#10;&#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

135530,"In May of 1863 the Confederacy was winning battles but losing the war. In the west Grant was moving on Vicksburg. In the east, the Army of Northern Virginia was holding off the Army of the Potomac, but Lee realized that this could not last forever. Something had to change, he would strike north and take the war to the enemy. After weeks of maneuver, a chance collision between the two armies would seal the fate of the Confederacy. Now is your chance to change history. Can you do better than Lee and crush the Union army as it arrives piecemeal? Or as Meade will you hold the heights and dash the last great hope of Confederate victory? The decisions are yours&hellip; in Gettysburg 150!&#10;&#10;Gettysburg 150 is an expansion of the ideas contained in Hold the Line. Like Hold the Line, it uses command action points for units to move and attack. The CRT is simliar, although artillery is weaker at longer ranges due to the greater scale of the battle. However, the board is not modular and infantry units are stronger. Units are division level, with brigade level cavalry. Advanced features like column movement is covered simply with movement bonuses for not moving adjacent to enemy units. More importantly, the game has optional rules to increase realism, including early reinforcements, army demoralization due to heavy losses, and rules to encourage corps organization. The game has 4 scenarios covering days 1, 2, and 3, as well as the Confederate attack on Little Round Top on July 2. Scenarios are playable in 1 hour for the day battles, 20 to 30 minutes for the Little Round Top scenario. The complete 3 day battle is playable in 2.5 to 3 hours.&#10;&#10;A division level Gettysburg game in honor of the 150th anniversary of the battle.  This simple fast playing game comes with a mounted 25 x 22 map, two counter sheets, rules, and dice.  You can play the entire battle in 2 to 3 hours, with 4 shorter scenarios.&#10;&#10;Players will maneuver the counters representing the Union and Confederate armies across a hex cover representation of the battlefield at Gettysburg.  Each turn players get a number of action points that will allow them to maneuver, fire combat, and close combat enemy forces.  You will always receive some action points, but will never be sure exactly how many recreating the uncertainty of command and control. Victory is obtained by driving the enemy from the field by capturing terrain objectives or eliminating enemy units.&#10;&#10;The game uses the popular Hold the Line game system as its base.  Optional rules include a Chaos of War table, force march, and more.&#10;&#10;Includes a mounted game board, 2 counter sheets with large 7/8&quot; counter sheets, dice, and rules.&#10;&#10;",2,120,10,1,120,Gettysburg 150,120,2013,"Sean Cooke,Brandon Pennington","American Civil War,Wargame","Grant Wylie,Mike Wylie",Hold the Line,"Action Point Allowance System,Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter",Worthington Games,7.33565,69,2-3

You get two random spells at the start of each game, then can acquire more via short, &quot;once around&quot; auctions at the start of each round. You bid energy cubes in these auctions, and you have only ten, so bid wisely. When you win an auction, you place energy cubes equal to your bid on the spell card. A certain number of these cubes are removed from the card at the end of each round; once the final cube is removed, the spell leaves the game and you lose that power.&#10;&#10;Spell cards generate the Element cards depicted on them for their owners. You then use these Element cards to bid on and collect Ingredients.

137498,"publisher's description&#10;&#10;Breaking the Chains (BtC) simulates a hypothetical future military conflict over the South China and East China Seas around the year 2021. Conflicting claims of sovereignty have roiled those &quot;near seas&quot; since the Cold War. After decades of patient diplomacy, Beijing's new navy could offer military options for finally asserting sovereignty over prizes within the First Island Chain - that string of islands which runs from the Ryukus south through Taiwan, the Philippines and then curls back to the mainland via Malaysia. BtC presumes that China comes to blows with a Southeast Asian country in a conflict that could expand to possibly include: Australia, India, Japan, the United States as well as a variety of Southeast Asian nations. However, beyond China and one South East Asian nation, the exact composition of opposing coalitions is not predetermined but rather a function of the decisions players make as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Two or more people play BtC with two reference cards, dice, and about 350 counters on a 22&quot; X 34&quot; map where each hex spans about 70 nautical miles (80 land miles) and each turn represents one day of real time. Players alternate maneuvering air, ground and naval units for up to 14 nations to resolve battles with a universal &quot;strike&quot; mechanism that applies across all types of combat; missile defense capabilities are central to survival. Air units represent from 30-90 aircraft each, most ground units are regiments, and naval units are small groups of surface ships/submarines or individual aircraft carriers. Specialized chit play simulates black ops, cyber warfare and various political developments.&#10;&#10;BtC is solitaire friendly. The naval operations which dominate play are based on a roll-to-evade model rather than search-to-find model. That means, owing to a battle space awash in electromagnetic emissions, enemy positions - except for motionless submarines - are assumed to be known unless a last-minute dice roll determines a potential target has evaded detection. So there is no &acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#156;hidden movement&acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#157; to stifle solitaire play; and the &acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#156;hidden placement&acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#157; of submarines can be forgone.

This is why he asks the monasteries belonging to Cluny to deliver food.&#10;&#10;In Domus Domini, each player is an abbot who leads such a monastery. Each year (i.e. every round) players produce a yield, then deliver it to Cluny. Petrus Venerabilis uses the revenue from the yields to make life easier for the monks. The player who delivers the highest yield in a round gains the most Glory (victory points). However, he will get the least support (thalers) for further investments. Whoever delivers the lowest yield in a round receives the least Glory, but the most thalers for further investments. Consequently, players need to decide in each round whether they want to earn more thalers in order to invest in the development of their monastery, or to obtain more Glory in order to be the winner in the end.&#10;&#10;But each player pursues his own plans, so every round brings a scramble for the best ranking on the street to Cluny, which might bring unpleasant surprises to some players.&#10;&#10;",6,120,12,2,120,Domus Domini,120,2015,Franz Vohwinkel,Strategy,Heinz-Georg Thiemann,Crowdfunding: Startnext,Worker Placement,franjos Spieleverlag,6.5974,96,2-3

Inside each box, an apprentice will find a succession scroll. Contained on the scroll is the last piece of knowledge required to become the Drago Magi &mdash; but only one can claim the title. Each scroll holds a different &quot;Spell of Succession&quot; that may be executed only with the correct combination of rare gems. These magically imbued gems appear in sets of three only during times of succession and must be collected by dragons at the command of each apprentice. The competitor who is first to collect the gems needed to complete his Spell of Succession becomes the new Drago Magi. For the loser, the unofficial title whispered under the breath of the people is &quot;Novitius Eterna&quot; or &quot;Forever a Novice&quot;.&#10;&#10;Be swift and remember, there is little room for error.&#10;&#10;Draco Magi is a card game designed by Richard Launius and Robert Burke. To start, each player selects an apprentice dragon mage he wishes to play. Each mage receives a deck of dragon cards that includes multiple copies of four different chromatic dragons (Green, Red, Black &amp; Purple), four different metallic dragons (Gold, Silver, Brass &amp; Bronze), and two special dragon cards (the Battle dragon and the Polar dragon). Each dragon has a different strength, weakness and special ability. Players will send their dragons, one at a time, to capture gems on different battlefields; each battlefield offers a different effect that may give an advantage or disadvantage to certain types of dragons.&#10;&#10;Players alternate playing dragon cards on battlefields until they have played all eight of their Dragon cards. Each player can play a maximum of three dragons on a single battlefield. When a dragon is placed, it may make a ranged attack. Not all dragons have a ranged attack breath weapon, but those that do have a breath weapon icon with a number. The number indicates the number of battle cards the player may reveal when attempting to hit with a ranged attack. A defender may defend with the number of cards equal to the dragon's shield value. A ranged attack can take place immediately only when the card is played against an opposing dragon. If a ranged attack is not used at this moment, the ranged attack is forfeited for the current round.&#10;&#10;After all dragon cards have been played, the melee phase of the battle begins. Each dragon has a &quot;melee attack&quot; value printed on its card which represents the number of battle cards the player can draw for the battle. The melee battle mechanism is a unique attack and counter system that provides opportunity for deduction, subtlety, and deadly combos. Players will also earn advance battle cards that build up their decks over the course of the game. The player with the most dragons present on a battlefield wins that gem. In the case of a tie, the dragons and gem remain for the next round.&#10;&#10;Draco Magi is a fast game heavily connected to its theme that incorporates area control, bluffing, hand management, deck building and deduction.&#10;&#10;",2,30,12,2,30,Draco Magi,30,2014,"Ertaç Altinöz,Kerem Beyit,Luis Francisco","Card Game,Fantasy","Robert Burke,Richard Launius","Animals: Dragons,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter","Area Control / Area Influence,Card Drafting,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management","Dragonsmith,Grey Fox Games,Robert Burke Games",6.62197,575,2-3

This means they can react to the often unpredictable results of long entry effect chains, or to cards that their opponents play defensively during your turn.&#10;&#10;The game is also customisable: you can adjust the complexity or game length by adding more Staks for each player or by changing basic game mechanics.&#10;&#10;",6,10,7,2,10,Stak Bots,10,2013,Tom Norfolk,Card,Tom Norfolk,,Hand Management,"2D6.EE,DogEared Games",6.41212,132,2-3

143882,"In the trick-taking card game ebbes, players need to keep on their toes each round as how they're going to score (or lose!) points might not be determined until the round is well underway.&#10;&#10;The deck in ebbes contains five colors of cards, and with three, four or five players, you use cards 1-6, 1-8 or 1-10. (Thus, each player is always dealt 10 cards.) In addition to the deck, you play with five number-designation cards (numbered 1-5), five color-designation cards that match the card colors, and a player aide board.&#10;&#10;Game play follows the pattern of traditional trick-taking games. The lead player for a trick plays one card, and the other players must follow suit if possible, while throwing any other card if they can't. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless one or more trump cards were played, in which case the highest trump card wins the trick &mdash; but at the start of the round, trump is undetermined! To back up a step, at the start of the round, the first player reveals the top number-designation card; the numeral on that card helps determine trump as well as which cards earn or cost players points. If the number-designation card shows &quot;7&quot;, for example, then the color of the first 7 played determines the trump color for the round; use a color-designation card to mark the trump color on the player aide. What's more:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The second 7 determines which color is worth positive points; each card of this color is worth 1 point at the round's end.&#10;    The third 7 determines which the &quot;ebbes&quot; color &mdash; &quot;ebbes&quot; meaning &quot;something&quot; in Palatine; at round's end, the player(s) who don't have the most or fewest cards of this color each earn 3 points.&#10;    The fourth 7 determines which color is worth negative points; each card of this color is worth -1 point at the round's end.&#10;&#10;&#10;After four colors have been determined, the fifth color is automatically the &quot;nix&quot; color. Whoever has the most of these cards chooses the start player for the next round - after cards have been dealt for that round. At the start of the new round, reveal a new number-designation card. After all of the number-designation cards have been played &mdash; that is, after the fifth round &mdash; the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Two variants are included with ebbes. The first variant extends the game (and probably lengthens the &quot;determining&quot; time) by adding more cards to the deck. In the second variant, players take turns placing a color-designation card on the number-designation card of their choice, and those five particular cards determine the colors for trump, positive points, etc. as each of them is played. The game's website gives rules for a third variant in which each player discards one card at the start of the round, and the player in last place gets to look at these cards; whoever takes the final trick takes these cards prior to scoring.&#10;&#10;",5,45,10,3,45,ebbes,45,2013,Ronja Hähnlein,Card,Klaus Geis,,Trick-taking,Palatia Spiele,6.82091,232,2-3

Players then use these resources to erect buildings on their own village boards, attempting to complete rows and columns for population points. Whoever can build the biggest and most prosperous town will end up with the biggest population and win the game!&#10;&#10;New Haven is a tile-laying game with a drafting component. The center board is the land between the player villages from which resources will be gathered. Players select from their two hidden tiles and play on this board to generate available value in some of the four resources. Once per game, each player can get a shipment which delivers a large value of one specific resource type.&#10;&#10;This value is then used by the player to play building tokens on his personal village board. However, he can play only building tokens already owned behind his player screen, with restrictions on how buildings must be arranged. He can elect to play a token face down for more flexibility, but this means a lower score if he successfully completes that row or column of buildings.&#10;&#10;Once a player is done building, any value he hasn't used is available for his opponents to use to build! Thus, the goal when placing resource tiles is to generate just enough for what is needed, not the most that can possibly be created. Finally, the player drafts new building tokens for use on future turns; plan your creation and consumption of resources to perfectly match your needs, and you'll be rewarded with additional tokens.&#10;&#10;The base game lasts ten turns, and the player who attracts the most colonists to his village by completing roads and avenues of buildings wins the game.&#10;&#10;New Haven plays well with 2, 3, or 4 players, lasting about 15 minutes per player, with a bit more time needed for learning games. The game includes a side B game board with some twists, as well as rule variants that can make the gameplay either more forgiving or more strategic.&#10;&#10;",4,60,12,2,60,New Haven,60,2013,"Dennis Lohausen,Jennifer Vargas",Strategy,"Brian Leet,Kevin Worden",Colonial Theme,Tile Placement,R&R Games,6.56232,345,2-3

Your Kampfruppe may also be assigned air support and heavy weapons support in order to achieve your goals. Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.&#10;&#10;Tiger Leader features nine historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts.

You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. Double sided terrain tiles provide everything from cities and farmland to snow covered forests and hills to sand dunes and oases.&#10;&#10;During combat, you get to resolve every fight with enemy tanks, infantry, anti-tank guns, and squads of infantry. Each enemy tank, truck, infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;After combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger!

I'll be wandering about the park, and if you're the first one to find me, you win! Won't that be delightful?&quot;&#10;&#10;Rattlebones is a game about transforming dice.

Players each get 3 d6 (black, white, gray) -- basic d6 but the '1' is replaced by Rattlebones.&#10;- Place random tiles on the empty spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;Your Turn&#10;Roll a die. May spend 1-2 gold to roll an extra 1-2 dice. Then, use each die one at a time:&#10;- if Rattlebones shows, move Rattlebones back one space; game ends immediately if it hits a player score marker and most points wins.&#10;- if pips or Rattlebones showing, move one of your pawns clockwise that many spaces (RB=1) and use the space you land on. Typically, you may add a die face matching that space to the die you used (replace any face except Rattlebones).&#10;- otherwise, take whatever action the face allows (e.g., earn a stock marker or star token, which you may later turn in for VP; earn VP; steal stuff from other people; etc.).&#10;&#10;",4,30,14,2,15,Rattlebones,30,2014,"Martin Hoffmann,Claus Stephan,Mirko Suzuki",Dice,Stephen Glenn,"Admin: Better Description Needed!,Animals: Apes / Monkeys,Animals: Mice","Deck / Pool Building,Dice Rolling,Modular Board,Roll / Spin and Move",Rio Grande Games,6.67354,646,2-3

You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down &mdash; that is, with the color hidden &mdash; in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.&#10;&#10;If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.&#10;&#10;When a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck.

Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.&#10;&#10;Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points).

If someone else plays the same amount of cards with a higher number, however, your cards get nicked! Stealing cards can be good, but if you can't use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they'll cost you points.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards. Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck. On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible. If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player &quot;abluxxes&quot; those opponents &mdash; that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn't take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards. Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards. (Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)&#10;&#10;As soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent.

The latest in steam technology will be on display to attract and transport visitors to the hotels and guest houses that line the seafronts. Amusements and monuments will be created to edify and delight the visiting holiday-makers. You, as the designer of these developments must complete your resort first and claim your rightful place as Chief Architect, by Royal Appointment! Help is available from enigmatic and mysterious personages: Donkey-boy, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Madame Ice-cream. They may prove invaluable but are fickle and may aid your opponents, too!&#10;&#10;Steam Donkey is a card game that is fun but has depth to its strategic play. You will make decisions about when to take cards into your hand from the resort and whether to build in the Park, Beach or Town area. You, as the Architect will have to choose which characters will be of most use to you each turn and which projects they will help you construct. All for the glory of having the most magnificent resort in the land!&#10;&#10;An unusual mechanism in the game is that the reverse of each card is as important as its front. The reverse shows holiday-makers (&quot;the Visitors&quot;) arriving at a railway station complete with suitcases and their mechanical dog. The suitcases are color-coded to show the area of the resort to which the Visitors are destined. This area could be either the Park, the Town or the Beach. After they arrive, these same Visitors may be collected to the player's hand &mdash; but at this juncture the fronts of the cards become the focus of play. The players build amusements, lodgings, monuments and transport within the three areas, and this information is shown on the card fronts together with a point value. In order to build, a player discards a prescribed number of cards of the same type as the card being built. Of course, there is a little more to the game than this...&#10;&#10;Four Character cards &mdash; Madame Ice-cream, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Donkey-boy &mdash; are swapped between players to enhance card play, and four Kick-on cards in the advanced game &mdash; The Castle, Mechanical Dog, The Bank, and Feral Donkey &mdash; give the owning player a particular advantage and are retained throughout the game.&#10;&#10;",4,45,10,2,45,Steam Donkey,45,2014,Marco Primo,Card,"Gary Dicken,Steve Kendall,Phil Kendall","Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Steampunk","Card Drafting,Hand Management,Press Your Luck,Set Collection","GaGa Games,Ragnar Brothers",6.75774,235,2-3

By the end of the game, each player will have created a unique, custom neighborhood with areas that interact with each other, hoping to outscore the competition by having the best subdivision.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a subdivision player board and a hand of hex-shaped zone tiles. A parcel die is rolled to indicate the type of parcel where a zone tile may be placed, and all players simultaneously place one of their tiles. If a zone tile is placed next to existing zone tiles, those existing tiles have the ability to create new improvements, which may also be placed at this time. Those improvements provide money and points, while slowly covering up as many parcels as possible. Players pass the remaining zone tiles in hand to their left, then someone rolls the parcel die once again. This continues until only one zone tile remains in hand, which is discarded.&#10;&#10;Players then play another round, but at the start of the second, third, and fourth rounds, players first check to see whether they've achieved bonuses, which give them extra cash or allow for extra activations of certain zone tiles.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends, and scores are tallied, with players gaining points for parks being adjacent to other tiles, sidewalks passing through as many different zones and improvements as possible, schools ranking the best in the city, and zones connecting to the highway that runs around (or through) your subdivision.&#10;&#10;",4,45,13,1,45,Subdivision,45,2014,"Klemens Franz,Ollin Timm",Strategy,Lucas Hedgren,,"Card Drafting,Dice Rolling,Route/Network Building,Tile Placement","Bézier Games, Inc.",6.58102,827,2-3

Until the draw pile is gone, players must draw at the end of their turns to maintain a hand of at least three cards.&#10;&#10;All of a player's hand cards must be played before any of his face-up table cards, which must in turn be played before any of his face-down table cards.

For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.&#10;&#10;Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!&#10;&#10;The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.&#10;&#10;Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned.

Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&#10;&#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&#10;&#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&#10;&#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&#10;&#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution.

By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &mdash; all while avoiding pollution.&#10;&#10;Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.&#10;&#10;A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel.

You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&#10;&#10;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&#10;&#10;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&#10;&#10;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game.

166726,"England, a land so harsh that forged heroes and conquerors, where the people are so indomitable that not even the Roman Empire managed to subjugate them. England has built an extensive empire on which the sun never set, vastly extending its domain beyond the British Isles on the spur of the Plantagenets, a royal lineage that dominated much of medieval European history, a dynasty forged from steel and blood, a lineage that would prevail for more than half a millennium. Plantagenet is a name that inspires admiration among enemies and fear among allies.&#10;&#10;Henry II, the first Plantagenet king to extend and stabilize his domains, contracted a political marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, a marriage intended to generate heirs to the throne. This strategic alliance by marriage produced four heirs: children who would rebel against their own father, more than once, leading to war, bloodshed and pacification, the stuff history is made of.&#10;Who is going to inherit the throne? Who will prove to be worthy of the illustrious name of Plantagenet? After years of battles and rivalry, only two of the heirs survived.&#10;&#10;The first, opposed by his own father, is a man with a destiny marked out by his own land, which he rarely set foot on as he was preoccupied for his entire life in conquests beyond the British Isles. The hope of an entire era would depend on his choices. The difference between being the usurper or the chosen one would depend on his actions. He is Richard I of England, better known as Richard the Lionheart.&#10;The other, the last born, was far removed from the throne. Overshadowed by his own family, derided by his own people and saddled with the unfortunate title of &ldquo;Lackland&rdquo;, John Lackland had the opportunity of a lifetime: Richard left for the Crusades and John could claim the throne for himself in Richard&rsquo;s absence. But would he have the mettle of a king? Would he surpass his more illustrious brother Richard? Would he be able to counter his brother&rsquo;s supporters?&#10;&#10;A wise choice as to with whom to form an alliance is crucial to one&rsquo;s place in history. Only brave choices will crown the true king of England, and only those who loyally and valiantly supported him in the conquest and administration of the kingdom would be remembered in history. This is a choice that only the strong and the wise would make.This is history.&#10;&#10;In Richard I, the players assume the role of the characters who remained in England when King Richard I left for the Crusades. They have to decide which side to take without knowing whether Richard I will return home a victor with glory and riches, or he won't come back at all (but there are many possible intermediate outcomes).&#10;&#10;During the game, the players take turns to influence the different characters available in order to earn prestige points (PPs) for themselves, but also to use their powers to influence the Crusade from far away by sending resources. A player might even decide to betray his own side, if worrying news were to come from the East...&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the outcome of the Crusade leads to an increase of PPs for the players who were deployed by the faction which has achieved its goal, but the game has only one winner: the player who has accumulated the most PPs, regardless of the faction to which he belongs!&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to amass the most Prestige Points (PP) by wisely choosing alliances and exerting influence on the performance of the Crusade.&#10;&#10;",8,60,12,3,60,Richard I,60,2014,"Diana Cammarano,Daniele Solfrini",Strategy,Andrea Chiarvesio,,"Co-operative Play,Partnerships,Variable Player Powers","District Games,First Editions",7.05458,120,2-3

And while you may get hurt along the way, sometimes it's best to just push ahead, because the Valkyries don't come to claim the dead immediately...&#10;&#10;Bottlecap Vikings is a small rondel game with a ton of replayability. The rondel spaces are not fixed in place- they are randomized at the beginning of the game. Not only that, they're double-sided, so you might never play on the exact same configuration twice. There are two different victory conditions, and players each have a small &quot;tech-tree&quot; in their city with multiple viable paths. Furthermore, the city cards are double-sided, one side is identical for all players, and the other side is unique. To top it off, the crux of the gameplay is the push-your-luck damage system, which makes you value spaces differently depending on how damaged you or others already are.&#10;&#10;Bottlecap Vikings is packaged with 3 mini-expansions for other Tasty Minstrel Games&#10;Harbour: Ice Viking&#10;Gold West: Bandits Promo&#10;Eminent Domain: Battlecruisers &#226;&#128;&#147; Heavy Assault&#10;&#10;",4,15,8,2,15,Bottlecap Vikings,15,2015,Dave Fulton,Strategy,Andy Van Zandt,"TMG Microgames,TMG Originals,Vikings",Modular Board,Tasty Minstrel Games,5.33061,277,2-3

Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.&#10;&#10;All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.&#10;&#10;The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)&#10;&#10;The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.&#10;&#10;The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.&#10;&#10;The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.&#10;&#10;When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.&#10;&#10;The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.&#10;&#10;Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level.

Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&#10;&#10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&#10;&#10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round.

Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end.

In 1919, the requisite number of legislatures of the States ratified the 18th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, enabling national Prohibition within one year of ratification. Prohibition began on January 16, 1920 when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect. During this time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (a.k.a. bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States. Federal Prohibition agents were given the task of enforcing the law. Even though the sale of alcohol was illegal, alcoholic drinks were still widely available at &quot;speakeasies&quot; and other underground drinking establishments.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Opulent, a posh speakeasy located in vibrant Atlantic City!

Politicians, mobsters, aristocrats, and social celebrities are all seeking a grand time in your club. Entertain your patrons with upbeat jazz tempos, or melodic waltzes, with the Opulent jazz band. Fancy the illegal indulgences of your patrons by preparing them an exotic mixed drink, a good whisky on the rocks, or even a simple brew.

You win by being the first player to play all of your tiles.&#10;&#10;The first player selects one tile from their rack and places it in the center square on the board. The next player, and then each in turn, can add one tile to the board, but that tile must be set adjacent to one or more existing tiles, and it must match each adjacent tile based on either color or shape. If you match more than one tile, or you place your tile on one of the sun squares on the board, you get stones that can be traded in for extra moves, allowing you to get rid of your tiles faster. You can also use the special wind tiles to move a tile already on the board over by one square.&#10;&#10;As you play Latice, you&rsquo;ll learn to plan your turns and extra moves ahead of time. You&rsquo;ll strategically use wind tiles to alter the layout of the board, and play both offensively and defensively based on your knowledge of the remaining tiles.

Shove too many in one cage, and they'll be worth almost nothing to you.&#10;&#10;In each round, someone deals a line of twelve cards face up on the table; each card depicts an animal (a curio in the original version) along with a point value and a limit. The starting player splits the line in two by choosing a dividing point. Each player holds two cards showing the left or right group, and each player chooses, then simultaneously reveals which group of cards they want. If only one player chooses a side, they take all the cards in that group and add them to their personal tableau. If a side is chosen by more than one player, however, then one of the players who chose it splits that group into two smaller groups, then everyone who originally chose this group secretly votes again for which group they want. This process repeats with each group until either each player has taken some number of cards or groups have been reduced to single cards and two or more players are still voting to take them; in this case, those single cards are placed in a special pile. At the start of a round, the starting player adds a special card to the line-up and whoever wins this card collects all of the animals in this special pile.&#10;&#10;Players complete three rounds this way, then score points. If a group of cards has exceeded the limit on it &mdash; say, by collecting four cards when the limit is three &mdash; then the owner of these cards scores only 1 point per card instead of the point value for each card. Some cards in the game allow you to remove cards from your collection, possibly allowing you to stay under the limit and score more points. You might also start trying not to win cards so as not to spoil the value of what you've already collected.

Lovecraft, known worldwide for his short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;. In the game, you evoke the powers of the Ancient Ones to drive your fellow cultists mad while securing your path to victory. To play, you first deal each player two cards from a deck that contains cards numbered 6-12, then you count out 17 face-down cards, flip the remainder face up, shuffle the deck, then lay it out in a row so that all players can see the cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either take 1-3 cards, open a portal, or open an investigation. When you take card, you pick up the first 1-3 cards in the row, then add them to your hand. To open a portal, you lay down three or more cards of the same type, then take the portal matching the number on those cards. Each portal has a different power, and you can use any one portal power on your turn. If someone else claims a portal that you own, too bad! You just lost the portal! To open an investigation, discard cards numbered 6-12, after which every other player gains as many madness tokens as the number of investigations this round.&#10;&#10;A round ends when one player runs out of cards or the card row runs out. In the latter case, everyone takes one final turn, then all players gain madness tokens equal to the number of different types of cards in their hand. If a player empties their hand, that player loses half of their madness tokens while everyone else gains one.&#10;&#10;The game ends the round that a player has collected ten or more madness tokens.&#10;&#10;",4,30,8,2,0,Pocket Madness,30,2016,Mathieu Leyssenne,Card,"Bruno Cathala,Ludovic Maublanc",Cthulhu Mythos,"Hand Management,Set Collection",Funforge,6.35387,181,2-3

At the beginning of a round, each player has four turns to set their own scoring and goals for the trick-taking that follows, and this is mostly done by betting. Players can bet on tricks taken, on the number of cards of a given color in your takes, on the last trick, on the highest card taking, or even on the failure of your opponent. Instead of betting, players can choose other actions as well.&#10;&#10;Players can have up to four bets, but only those that you've won will earn you coins. For this reason and because the odds of the bets differ (x2, x3, x4, x5), sometimes instead of betting players will want to take other actions, such as changing one of their cards, doubling an odd, becoming the starting player in the trick phase, changing one of their bets, etc. This is where the tactical depth of Sponsio comes in: finding the best combinations to build your highest score!&#10;&#10;Sponsio is a family-strategy game that can be won in two ways: collecting 30 coins or winning 9 bets in a row.&#10;&#10;",4,45,10,3,30,Sponsio,45,2016,"Vincent Burger,Niki Czank",Card,József Dorsonczky,Gladiators,"Betting/Wagering,Hand Management,Trick-taking","Fullcap Games,Gém Klub Kft.,Ludicus,Mind Fitness Games,PixieGames",6.82676,71,2-3

The old city walls have just been torn down, finally freeing the city's growth outward towards the old villages that surround it. Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.&#10;&#10;Barcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.&#10;&#10;During the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct. At the end of each era, all those workers are placed into a bag, alongside peacekeeping soldiers. Depending on the level of unrest, a number of these figures are drawn from the bag and the player with more figures drawn from their color suffers a strike.&#10;&#10;",4,90,10,2,70,Barcelona: The Rose of Fire,90,2016,David Parcerisa,Strategy,"Marco Maggi,Francesco Nepitello","Catalonia,Cities: Barcelona (Spain)","Area Control / Area Influence,Tile Placement",Devir,6.75758,124,2-3

Players begin with four cards in their mansion (personal area), and cards are available in the Freak Shop (common zone at the center of the table). Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives. To achieve this, they try to make the best trades between cards currently in their mansion and cards available in the Shop so that their collection grows in both quantity and value, while also best fitting the objectives.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you make one single trade between cards currently in your mansion and cards available in the Shop.
